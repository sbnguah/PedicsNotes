## Introduction

Pediatric haematology requires an understanding of how the blood and blood-forming organs develop
anatomically, how they function physiologically, and how disease processes disrupt these systems.
Children differ significantly from adults in their hematologic profiles due to developmental
changes, increased metabolic demands, and perinatal transitions. In Ghana and Sub-Saharan Africa,
the clinical spectrum is strongly influenced by infectious diseases (malaria, HIV, TB), nutritional
deficiencies, and inherited disorders such as sickle cell disease (SCD).

This chapter provides an integrated review of **anatomy**, **physiology**, and **pathology** of the
hematopoietic system, with emphasis on conditions most relevant to children in the region.

## Anatomy of the Hematologic System

The hematologic system includes the **bone marrow**, **blood cells**, **lymphoid organs**, the
**reticuloendothelial system**, vascular endothelium, and plasma proteins.

### Bone marrow

-   **Sites of hematopoiesis**
    -   *Fetal life:* yolk sac → liver & spleen → bone marrow (by third trimester).
    -   *Postnatal:* whole skeleton initially; becomes restricted to the axial skeleton (sternum,
        ribs, pelvis, vertebrae) during adolescence.
-   **Cellularity**
    -   Neonates and infants: very high cellularity (\~80–90%); gradually becomes fattier with age.
-   **Components**
    -   Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), stromal cells (fibroblasts, adipocytes), sinusoids, and
        supporting extracellular matrix.

**Clinical relevance:** High marrow activity in infants enables robust erythropoiesis but also means
bone marrow failure syndromes present early and dramatically. Bone marrow aspiration is essential
when leukaemia or aplasia is suspected.

### Lymphoid organs

-   **Thymus**
    -   Large and active in childhood; required for T-cell maturation.
    -   Involution begins in adolescence.
    -   Absent or underdeveloped thymus → severe T-cell deficiency (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome).
-   **Spleen**
    -   Filters aged/damaged RBCs; participates in immune responses and can host extramedullary
        hematopoiesis.
    -   Vulnerable to sequestration in SCD; frequently enlarged in malaria-endemic settings.
-   **Lymph nodes**
    -   More reactive and often enlarged in children due to frequent antigen exposure.

## Physiology of the Hematologic System

### Hematopoiesis

**Definition:** production of blood cells from multipotent HSCs.

**Developmental stages**

1.  Yolk sac hematopoiesis (early gestation)
2.  Foetal liver (mid to late gestation) — primary site until birth
3.  Bone marrow (dominant after birth)

**Paediatric differences**

-   Infants have higher baseline erythropoietic activity.
-   Lymphopoiesis is intensified during early childhood for immune maturation.

### Red blood cell physiology

-   **Haemoglobin switching:** HbF (α₂γ₂) predominates at birth (≈70–80%). Switch to HbA (α₂β₂)
    occurs over the first 6 months.
-   **Physiologic** anaemia of infancy: Postnatal fall in erythropoietin causes a nadir in
    haemoglobin at \~6–8 weeks; usually mild and self-limiting.
-   **Oxygen affinity:** HbF has higher O₂ affinity than HbA — clinically significant for newborn
    adaptation.

**Clinical links**

-   Hemoglobinopathies (e.g., SCD) typically become clinically significant after HbF declines.

-   Nutritional deficiencies (iron, folate, B12) rapidly impair RBC production due to high turnover.

### White blood cell physiology

-   **WBC composition:** Infants often have relative lymphocytosis; neutrophil counts are lower in
    early life than in older children and adults.
-   **Immune maturation:** Neonates and young infants have immature innate and adaptive immune
    responses.

**Clinical links**

-   Distinguish physiologic lymphocytosis from pathologic causes (e.g., lymphoid leukaemia).

-   Severe neutropenia increases the risk of fulminant bacterial infections.

### Platelet and coagulation physiology

-   **Platelet counts** in neonates are broadly similar to those of adults.
-   **Neonatal factor levels:** Lower vitamin K stores and reduced levels of some vitamin
    K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) increase bleeding risk.
-   **Vitamin K prophylaxis** at birth is crucial to prevent Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB).

## Pathology in Pediatric Haematology

Hematologic pathology in children can be classified by the affected cell line or process:
production, maturation, destruction, and hemostasis.

### Disorders of red blood cells

#### Anaemia (physiologic classification)

-   **Production failure:** iron deficiency, folate/B12 deficiency, bone marrow failure (aplastic
    anaemia).
-   **Destruction (hemolysis):** sickle cell disease, G6PD deficiency, malaria-related hemolysis,
    and immune hemolytic anaemia.
-   **Blood loss:** trauma, gastrointestinal blood loss (e.g., hookworm), peripartum haemorrhage.

**Local epidemiology (Ghana & region):**

-   Severe anaemia in children \<5 commonly results from malaria + iron deficiency.

-   Sickle cell disease is a major contributor to hemolytic anaemia and childhood morbidity.

#### Hemoglobinopathies

-   **Sickle cell disease (HbSS)**: vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, splenic
    sequestration, stroke risk.
-   **Thalassemias:** less frequent in West Africa than in the Mediterranean/SE Asia, but should be
    considered in microcytic anaemia unresponsive to iron.

#### Polycythemia

-   Neonatal polycythemia from delayed cord clamping, maternal diabetes, or twin-twin transfusion
    syndrome.

### Disorders of white blood cells

-   **Neutropenia:** viral causes, drug-induced (e.g., chloramphenicol), congenital forms.
-   **Leukocytosis & blasts:** often reactive, but a high blast percentage suggests leukaemia (ALL
    is the most common childhood leukaemia).
-   **Immunodeficiencies:** primary (SCID, DiGeorge) and secondary (malnutrition, HIV).

### Platelet and coagulation disorders

-   **Thrombocytopenia:** ITP (post-infectious), dengue (epidemic settings), marrow infiltration
    (leukaemia).
-   **Coagulation defects:** haemophilia A/B, von Willebrand disease, VKDB, and DIC (seen in severe
    sepsis and complicated malaria).

### Reticuloendothelial and lymphoid pathology

-   **Splenomegaly:** chronic malaria, SCD (early enlargement; later autosplenectomy), portal
    hypertension, malignancy.
-   **Lymphadenopathy:** reactive infections, TB lymphadenitis, lymphomas.

## 4 Integrating Anatomy, Physiology and Pathology — Clinical Perspectives

| Component | Normal (Anatomy/Physiology) | Pathology | Pediatric/Local Relevance |
|----------------------|---------------------------:|------------------------|------------------------|
| Bone marrow | High cellularity in infancy | Aplastic anaemia, leukaemia | Early pancytopenia is often dramatic |
| HbF → HbA switch | HbF is dominant at birth | SCD symptoms as HbF falls | Hydroxyurea raises HbF and reduces crises |
| Thymus | Central to T-cell maturation | Thymic aplasia → SCID | Recurrent severe infections in infancy |
| Spleen | Filters RBCs, immune role | Sequestration, autosplenectomy | Major role in SCD & malaria pathology |
| Vitamin K stores | Low in neonates | VKDB | Important in out-of-facility births |
| Immune maturation | Lymphocyte predominance early | Leukocyte disorders | Distinguish physiologic vs pathologic counts |

## Practical Approach to Common Presentations

### Child with pallor / suspected anaemia

1.  History: onset, feeding, bleeding, family history (hemoglobinopathies), recent infections, drug
    exposure.
2.  Examination: pallor distribution, jaundice, splenomegaly, and signs of heart failure.
3.  Initial investigations:
    -   Complete blood count (FBC) with indices
    -   Reticulocyte count
    -   Peripheral blood film (morphology; malaria parasites on thick/thin films)
    -   Malaria RDT where microscopy is unavailable
    -   Ferritin/iron studies, if available
    -   G6PD assay if hemolysis is suspected
4.  Management principles:
    -   Treat underlying cause (e.g., antimalarials, iron for deficiency).
    -   Transfusion for severe or symptomatic anaemia (local transfusion guidelines).

### Child with bleeding/bruising

1.  Obtain platelet count, PT/INR, and aPTT.
2.  Consider ITP, haemophilia, vWD, and DIC.
3.  Manage bleeding (local measures, tranexamic acid where indicated) and refer for factor assays or
    specialist care.

### 5.3 Suspected leukaemia

1.  Red flags: persistent fever, bone pain, bruising, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal white cell
    differential with blasts.
2.  Urgent FBC, blood film and prompt referral to a paediatric oncology unit for bone marrow
    aspirate and staging.

## Management Principles

-   **Supportive care:** hydration, treating infections, nutritional rehabilitation, and pain
    control.
-   **Transfusion therapy:** indicated for severe symptomatic anaemia, acute blood loss, or SCD
    complications (exchange transfusion for stroke/ACS).
-   **Disease-specific therapies:** iron replacement, hydroxyurea for SCD, factor replacement for
    haemophilia, chemotherapy for malignancies.
-   **Prevention:** newborn screening for SCD, universal vitamin K prophylaxis, routine
    immunisations, insecticide-treated nets and malaria chemoprophylaxis where indicated, and
    routine deworming.

## Summary

A working knowledge of the **anatomy** (bone marrow, thymus, spleen), **physiology** (developmental
hematopoiesis, haemoglobin switching, immune maturation), and pathology (anaemia,
hemoglobinopathies, leukaemias, bleeding disorders) is essential for pediatric practice. In Ghana
and across Sub-Saharan Africa, high-burden diseases such as malaria, SCD, and nutritional
deficiencies shape clinical priorities. Effective care depends on early recognition, appropriate
investigation (FBC, blood film, reticulocyte count, coagulation studies), timely supportive
measures, and referral for specialised therapies.
