## Definition

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the body’s immune system,
specifically the white blood cells called CD4 cells. HIV destroys these CD4 cells, weakening a
person’s immunity against opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, fungal infections, severe
bacterial infections, and some cancers.1

## Incidence/prevalence

Globally, 39 million people were living with HIV in 2022 out of which 1.5 million were children
below 15 years. In Ghana, out of 354,927 people living with HIV in 2022, 7% (24,845) were children
below 15 years. There were 16,574 new HIV infections in 2022 out of which 17% (2,818) were children.
Mother-to-child transmission of HIV at 6 weeks in 2022 was 9.12% while the final MTCT rate at 18
months was 17.75%. In 2022, there were 21,439 adolescents (10-19 years) living with HIV out of which
1,791 were newly infected.2

## Aetiology

HIV is a retrovirus with two main subtypes namely HIV 1 and HIV 2. HIV-1 is the most common type of
HIV and accounts for 99% of all infections in Ghana, whereas HIV-2 is relatively uncommon (0.08%)
and less infectious. Ghanaians co-infected with HIV 1 and HIV 2 form 0.02% of total infections.
HIV-2 is mainly concentrated in West Africa and the surrounding countries. HIV-2 is less fatal and
progresses more slowly than HIV-1. Modes of HIV transmission are sexual (80% in Ghana) mainly
heterosexual but also same-sex; parenteral transmission (5%) examples include blood transmission,
shared needles, and needle stick accidents, and mother-to-child transmission (15%) of which
in-utero, intrapartum and postpartum accounts for 10-25%, 60-75%, and 10-20% respectively.

## Pathogenesis

HIV entry, the first phase of the viral replication cycle, begins with the adhesion of the virus to
the host cell and ends with the fusion of the cell and viral membranes with subsequent delivery of
the viral core into the cytoplasm. The intricate series of protein-protein interactions that
ultimately result in virus infection can be divided into several phases, some of which are essential
and others that may modulate the efficiency of the process.3 Infection with HIV starts without
symptoms or ill-feeling and is accompanied by slight changes in the immune system. This stage spans
up to three months after infection until seroconversion where HIV-specific antibodies can be
detected in individuals following recent exposure. The outcome of infection and duration of disease
progression with clinical symptoms may vary greatly between individuals, but often it progresses
fairly slowly. It takes several years from primary infection to the development of symptoms of
advanced HIV diseases and immunosuppression.4 Although individuals may look healthy during primary
infection, the virus replicates in infected individuals' lymph nodes and bloodstream. As a result,
the immune system may get slowly damaged by the burst of viral load in their bodies.5

## Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms develop when the immune system’s ability to fight the disease is compromised due
to viral replication and reduced CD4 cells.

### Early/ acute HIV

Acute HIV infection, also known as primary HIV infection, can cause a range of symptoms that can
begin a few days after exposure to the virus and last for a few days to several months

### Late chronic HIV

The late stage of HIV infection is AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), which occurs when the
virus weakens the immune system.

### Staging of HIV

The extensive staging of HIV into 4 is shown in Table 3 (pages 15-16)
[here](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/43699/9789241595629_eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y "HIV Staging").

## Investigations

Depending on signs and symptoms, a patient could be suspected of HIV infection and AIDS. Children
are then tested for HIV depending on their age.

### Newborn to \<18 months

Younger children (\< 18 months) who are exposed to HIV or are suspected of HIV should be tested at
any time they have symptoms of HIV disease. The preferred test is the DNA PCR which is done using
dried blood spots (DBS) taken from pricking the heel of a child onto filter paper. If the test is
positive, the child should be started on treatment, but a second confirmatory test must be done.
Infants born to HIV-positive mothers without symptoms are routinely tested within 6 weeks of birth,
at 9 months of age using DNA PCR. At 18 months such children are tested with antibody tests using a
“triple algorithm” as detailed below.

### 18 months and above

Should be tested using the “triple algorithm” when a patient is sequentially tested using first
response, Oraquick, and SD biofilm test. ALL three tests must be positive before a child is
confirmed HIV positive. @fig-HivTestAlgorithm below gives further information

Baseline investigations are needed before initiating antiretroviral treatment/ monitoring of the
disease. These are listed in @tbl-hiv-investigations

When children are on treatment viral load tests are done regularly. This is done to detect early virological failure. When highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is started first viral load test is done at 6 months and then at 12 months. If there is virological suppression, then monitoring is done yearly. The table below outlines what to do with various viral load cut-offs and actions to take
