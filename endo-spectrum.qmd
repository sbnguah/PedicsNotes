## Introduction

Endocrinology is the study of hormones and the glands that produce them. In children, the endocrine
system governs critical processes such as growth, puberty, metabolism, and stress response.
**Pediatric endocrinology** focuses on disorders affecting hormone production, secretion, and action
during the developmental years.

Unlike adults, endocrine disorders in children often present with **growth disturbances**, **delayed
or precocious puberty**, or **developmental abnormalities**, rather than classical systemic
symptoms. A strong understanding of endocrine physiology, growth assessment, and hormonal feedback
mechanisms is essential for early recognition and management.

This essay outlines the anatomy and physiology of the endocrine system, key hormones, principles of
endocrine function testing, and an overview of common endocrine disorders in children.

## Anatomy and Physiology of the Endocrine System

The endocrine system consists of specialized glands that secrete hormones directly into the
bloodstream to act on distant target organs. These hormones regulate metabolism, electrolyte
balance, growth, and reproduction.

### Major Endocrine Glands in Children

| Gland        | Major Hormones                    | Primary Functions                     |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Hypothalamus | CRH, TRH, GHRH, GnRH              | Regulates pituitary secretion         |
| Pituitary    | GH, ACTH, TSH, LH, FSH, Prolactin | Growth, metabolism, reproduction      |
| Thyroid      | T3, T4, Calcitonin                | Metabolism, growth, brain development |
| Parathyroid  | PTH                               | Calcium and phosphate balance         |
| Adrenal      | Cortisol, Aldosterone, Androgens  | Stress response, electrolyte control  |
| Pancreas     | Insulin, Glucagon                 | Blood glucose regulation              |
| Gonads       | Oestrogen, Testosterone           | Pubertal development                  |
| Pineal       | Melatonin                         | Circadian rhythm                      |

These glands communicate through a hierarchy known as the **hypothalamic–pituitary–target gland
axis**.

## The Hypothalamic–Pituitary Axis

The **hypothalamus** integrates neural and hormonal signals to regulate endocrine function. It
secretes releasing or inhibiting hormones into the hypophyseal portal system that act on the
**pituitary gland**.

The **pituitary**, often termed the “master gland,” releases trophic hormones that stimulate target
organs such as the thyroid, adrenal glands, and gonads.

#### Example of Hormonal Axes

| Axis    | Hypothalamic Hormone | Pituitary Hormone | Target Organ   | Target Hormone          |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Thyroid | TRH                  | TSH               | Thyroid gland  | T3, T4                  |
| Adrenal | CRH                  | ACTH              | Adrenal cortex | Cortisol                |
| Gonadal | GnRH                 | LH, FSH           | Ovaries/Testes | Oestrogen, Testosterone |
| Growth  | GHRH                 | GH                | Liver          | IGF-1                   |

Feedback loops maintain hormone balance: elevated target hormones inhibit hypothalamic and pituitary
secretion, preventing overproduction.

## Principles of Hormone Action

Hormones exert their effects through **specific receptors** located either on the cell membrane
(peptide hormones) or within the cell (steroid and thyroid hormones).

### Types of Hormones

| Type | Examples | Mechanism of Action |
|----|----|----|
| **Peptide hormones** | GH, insulin, ACTH | Bind to cell-surface receptors → activate second messengers |
| **Steroid hormones** | Cortisol, oestrogen, testosterone | Enter cells → bind nuclear receptors → modulate gene transcription |
| **Amine hormones** | T3, T4, catecholamines | Derived from tyrosine → act on nuclear or membrane receptors |

Because of these mechanisms, hormone effects may be **rapid** (e.g., insulin, catecholamines) or
**delayed but sustained** (e.g., thyroid or steroid hormones).

## Growth and Development: A Central Theme

**Growth** is the most visible reflection of endocrine health in children. It results from the
interplay between genetics, nutrition, and hormones—particularly **growth hormone (GH)**, **thyroid
hormones**, **cortisol**, **sex steroids**, and **insulin**.

### Growth Hormone Axis

-   GH is secreted by the anterior pituitary in a pulsatile fashion.\
-   Stimulated by GHRH and inhibited by somatostatin.\
-   Acts on the liver to produce **Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1)**, which mediates bone and
    tissue growth.

**Deficiency of GH** leads to short stature with normal body proportions, while **excess GH** (rare
in children) causes gigantism.

## Assessment of Endocrine Function in Children

Because hormone levels fluctuate with time of day, age, and physiological state, interpretation of
results must be age-appropriate.

### Clinical Assessment

1.  **Detailed history**
    -   Growth pattern, family history of endocrine disorders.
    -   Pubertal changes, appetite, and energy levels.
2.  **Physical examination**
    -   Height and weight plotted on growth charts.
    -   Pubertal staging (Tanner).
    -   Dysmorphic features, goitre, pigmentation, or obesity.

### Laboratory Evaluation

-   **Basal hormone levels:** measured at specific times (e.g., morning cortisol).\
-   **Dynamic tests:**
    -   *Stimulation tests* (for suspected deficiency): e.g., GH stimulation, ACTH stimulation.
    -   *Suppression tests* (for suspected excess): e.g., dexamethasone suppression test.
-   **Imaging:** MRI of hypothalamic-pituitary region, thyroid ultrasound, or adrenal CT where
    indicated.
-   **Genetic testing:** for congenital or syndromic causes.

## Common Endocrine Disorders in Children

### Disorders of Growth and Pituitary Function

### Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)

-   Causes: congenital pituitary hypoplasia, tumours, trauma, or idiopathic.
-   Features: short stature, delayed bone age, infantile face, hypoglycaemia.
-   Diagnosis: low IGF-1, failed GH stimulation.
-   Treatment: recombinant GH therapy.

### Growth Hormone Excess

-   Usually from a pituitary adenoma.
-   Causes excessive linear growth (gigantism) or acromegalic features.
-   Managed surgically or with somatostatin analogues.

## Thyroid Disorders

### Congenital Hypothyroidism

-   Caused by thyroid dysgenesis or dyshormonogenesis.
-   Features: prolonged neonatal jaundice, macroglossia, hypotonia, umbilical hernia.
-   Early detection via newborn screening.
-   Treatment: lifelong levothyroxine replacement.

### Juvenile Hypothyroidism

-   Often autoimmune (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).
-   Features: growth retardation, fatigue, dry skin, constipation.
-   Managed with thyroid hormone replacement.

### Hyperthyroidism

-   Most commonly Graves’ disease (autoimmune).
-   Presents with weight loss, tachycardia, goitre, tremor.
-   Treatment includes antithyroid drugs (carbimazole), beta-blockers, or surgery.

## Adrenal Disorders

### Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

-   Autosomal recessive enzyme defect (most often 21-hydroxylase deficiency).
-   Features: ambiguous genitalia in females, dehydration, salt wasting.
-   Diagnosis: elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone.
-   Treatment: hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone replacement.

### Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison’s Disease)

-   Causes: autoimmune, infections (TB), or congenital defects.
-   Features: fatigue, hyperpigmentation, hypotension, salt craving.
-   Treatment: hydrocortisone and mineralocorticoid replacement.

### Cushing Syndrome

-   From prolonged steroid therapy or adrenal tumour.
-   Features: obesity, moon facies, striae, growth retardation.
-   Managed by reducing steroid dose or surgical excision of the tumour.

## Disorders of Puberty

### Precocious Puberty

-   Onset of secondary sexual characteristics before 8 years in girls, 9 years in boys.
-   May be central (early activation of HPG axis) or peripheral (excess sex steroids).
-   Requires MRI brain and hormonal evaluation.
-   Managed with GnRH analogues for central forms.

### Delayed Puberty

-   Absence of pubertal changes beyond 13 years (girls) or 14 years (boys).
-   May result from constitutional delay, hypogonadism, or chronic illness.
-   Treatment involves reassurance or sex steroid replacement when indicated.

## Disorders of Glucose Metabolism

### Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)

-   Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells.
-   Commonest endocrine disorder in children.
-   Symptoms: polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, fatigue.
-   Complication: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
-   Management: insulin therapy, dietary regulation, self-monitoring.

### Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)

-   Increasingly seen in obese adolescents.
-   Features: obesity, acanthosis nigricans, mild hyperglycaemia.
-   Managed by lifestyle changes, metformin, and sometimes insulin.

### Parathyroid and Calcium Disorders

-   **Hypocalcaemia** due to hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, or pseudohypoparathyroidism →
    tetany, seizures, Chvostek and Trousseau signs.
-   **Hypercalcaemia** due to hyperparathyroidism or malignancy → polyuria, vomiting, bone pain.
-   Management focuses on correcting calcium and vitamin D levels.

## Diagnostic Principles in Pediatric Endocrinology

Because hormone secretion in children changes with age and puberty, interpretation requires
**age-specific reference ranges**. For example: - Neonates have higher cortisol and thyroid hormone
levels. - GH secretion is pulsatile; random measurements are unreliable. - Pubertal staging is
crucial for evaluating gonadal hormones.

**Dynamic testing** remains a cornerstone of diagnosis:

-   *Stimulation tests* (GH, ACTH, GnRH) evaluate deficiency.

-   *Suppression tests* (dexamethasone, glucose tolerance) assess hormone excess.

In addition, **imaging** helps detect structural lesions, and **genetic testing** confirms syndromic
causes such as Prader–Willi, Turner, or Kallmann syndromes.

## Principles of Management

### Hormone Replacement

-   Use physiological doses to mimic normal secretion (e.g., hydrocortisone 3 times daily rather
    than dexamethasone).
-   Regular adjustment according to growth and puberty.

### Suppression of Hormone Excess

-   Antithyroid drugs, glucocorticoid therapy for CAH, or GnRH analogues for precocious puberty.

### Treatment of Underlying Causes

-   Surgery for tumours, antibiotics for infections, or withdrawal of exogenous steroids.

### Long-Term Follow-Up

-   Regular growth and pubertal assessment.
-   Monitoring for treatment side effects (e.g., growth suppression from steroids).
-   Transition planning for adult endocrinology care.

## Growth Monitoring and Interpretation

Growth assessment is central to paediatric endocrinology.\
Essential tools include:

-   **Growth charts:** plot height, weight, BMI, and head circumference.
-   **Mid-parental height:** predicts target range.
-   **Growth velocity:** \<4 cm/year after age 4 suggests pathology.
-   **Bone age:** X-ray of left hand/wrist compared with standards (Greulich–Pyle).

Discrepancy between bone age and chronological age helps differentiate **constitutional delay** from
**endocrine causes** of short stature.

## Psychosocial Aspects

Endocrine disorders can profoundly affect self-esteem, body image, and school performance.\
Children with delayed puberty or short stature may face bullying or anxiety, while those with
obesity or hirsutism may experience social withdrawal.

Management should include:

-   Psychological counselling.\
-   Support groups and family education.\
-   Encouragement of normal participation in school and sports.
