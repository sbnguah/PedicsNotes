## Definition

Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder in which multiple organ systems are affected and is
typically characterised by distinct facial features, short stature, congenital heart disease and
neurodevelopment abnormalities.

## Genetics

NS occurs sporadically or in an autosomal dominant manner, the latter being the most common mode of
transmission. In either case, males and females are affected equally. In familial cases, the mother
is usually the transmitting parent because a considerable proportion of affected males have problems
with fertility. Several mutations in the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system
(RAS)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have been implicated. Such mutations are
currently detected in approximately 70% of cases. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12q24.1
are by far the commonest. There is a correlation between specific gene mutations and the clinical
manifestations of the syndrome. Autosomal recessive forms of the disorder have also been identified.

## Clinical features

The clinical manifestations depend on the affected gene and the stage of life at which the patient
is presenting. Suggestive findings on prenatal ultrasound scans include lymphatic system anomalies
such as increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma and fetal ascites. Other supportive findings
include polyhydramnios, short femur length, renal and cardiac defects (particularly pulmonary valve
dysplasia) in the fetus. At birth, most affected neonates appear unremarkable. Birth weight and head
circumference are usually within the normal range. A cardiac murmur may be detected on routine
newborn examination. Male neonates may have cryptorchidism. The affected infant may present with
feeding difficulties requiring ongoing nasogastric feeding or gastrostomy, which can impair growth.
Talipes equinovarus may be present in 5% of patients. The characteristic facial features of NS
become more apparent in early childhood and include a triangular-shaped face, hypertelorism,
blue-green irises, down-slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, ptosis, low-set ears with
thickened posteriorly rotated auricles, high nasal bridge and upturned nose, short webbed neck and
micrognathia. Short stature is present in 85% of cases. Cutaneous features in childhood include
lymphedema affecting the lower limbs and genitals, follicular keratosis of the face and extensor
surfaces, multiple lentigines and café au lait spots. Musculoskeletal features include a shield
chest, cubitus valgus, pectus carinatum or excavatum, scoliosis, and joint laxity. Affected children
are usually hypotonic with delayed motor and speech development. Expressive language skills are more
affected. A careful family history is important with emphasis on the presence of congenital heart
disease, short stature or unusual facies among first-degree relatives.

## Associations

Congenital heart disease is present in almost 80% of patients with NS. The main cardiac lesion is a
dysplastic or stenotic pulmonic valve. Other associated cardiac defects include hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (30%), [atrial septal defect](cvs-asd.qmd), [ventricular septal
defects](cvs-vsd.qmd), [tetralogy of Fallot](cvs-tof.qmd), and [coarctation of the
aorta](cvs-coa.qmd). Most patients have more than one cardiac defect. Renal anomalies such as
ectopic kidneys are present in 10% of cases. Fifty per cent of affected males have cryptorchidism
with hypoplastic testes. There is an increased risk of the development of certain cancers because of
gene mutations affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway, an important cell signalling pathway. These include
neuroblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, low-grade glioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, juvenile
myelomonocytic leukaemia and myeloproliferative disorders. There are associated autoimmune diseases
such as systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune thyroiditis. Seizure disorders, unexplained
peripheral neuropathy and intellectual disabilities have been documented in association with NS.

## Investigations

Amniocentesis for the fetal karyotype can be done if prenatal USG findings are suggestive. A normal
karyotype rules out [Turner syndrome](synd-turners.qmd) which is a close differential. Genetic
studies to identify the specific gene mutation are important to help confirm the diagnosis and
determine prognosis. Other investigations are conducted based on the affected organ systems. These
include echocardiography and electrocardiography for cardiac defects, coagulation screen with full
hematologic workup for associated bleeding and neoplastic disorders, renal ultrasonographic
examination for genitourinary problems and brain and spine MRI if neurologic symptoms are present.

## Treatment

Treatment is focused on the presenting symptoms and the affected organ systems. A multidisciplinary
team made up of paediatricians, geneticists, cardiologists, haematologists, ophthalmologists,
neurologists, urologists, endocrinologists, audiologists, physical therapists, speech therapists,
occupational therapists, clinical psychologists, and social workers is needed to manage the various
complications associated with NS. Growth hormone therapy can be given to affected children with
growth impairment to accelerate growth to a near-normal adult height.

## Complications

These include delayed or absent puberty, neurodevelopment and behavioural problems such as autism
spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and seizure disorders. Other
complications are bleeding diathesis most commonly from factors XI and XII deficiency and platelet
disorders. Ophthalmologic complications include strabismus, amblyopia, refractive errors, posterior
embryotoxon, optic nerve hypoplasia and nystagmus. Progressive hearing loss (sensorineural,
conductive, or mixed loss) and recurrent otitis media are known to occur. Orthopaedic complications
include joint contractures, fusion of the cervical spine and scoliosis.

## Notes on counselling

Parents need to be counselled regarding recurrence risk with each pregnancy in familial cases and
prenatal diagnosis offered. Families of affected children need to be informed that although there is
no definitive cure for NS, the various associations and complications can be managed very well by a
multidisciplinary team to ensure the child has an excellent quality of life. Affected children with
mild or no learning difficulties do not require special education but can integrate well into
mainstream schools. Families of affected children should be linked to support groups. Patients with
bleeding disorders must be advised against the use of aspirin and aspirin-containing products or
other medications that may interfere with coagulation or platelet function.
