## The health newborn

-   Cries / Breathes normally
-   Pink all over
-   Well-flexed & moves all limbs spontaneously
-   Suckles well at the breast
-   Birth weight 2.5 -- 4.0kg
-   Normal vitals signs

## Occurrences at birth

-   The fluid in the alveoli is absorbed and replaced by air. If the transition is not smooth, it
    results in insufficient oxygen delivery to the vital organs...
-   Poor muscle tone
-   Respiratory distress or depression
-   Slow heart rate
-   Low BP
-   Cyanosis

## Birth Asphyxia

### Definition

::: callout-important
### World Health Organisation definition

Birth Asphyxia is the medical condition resulting from deprivation of oxygen in the newborn that
lasts long enough during the birth process to cause harm, usually to the brain.
:::

### Risk factors

Any condition that will lead to impairment of oxygenation or blood flow to the newborn's brain in
the perinatal period. These include:

-   Prolonged labour (CPD)
-   Placental failure
-   Cord around the neck
-   Problems with oxygenation of maternal blood / maternal disease
-   Anaemia and bleeding in the baby
-   Congenital heart disease
-   Infections
-   Deficient medical skills and or knowledge

### Presentation

The asphyxiated baby may have any of the following:

-   Poor Apgar Scores
-   May not cry at birth
-   Floppy/spastic
-   Breathing problems
-   Unresponsive
-   Seizures
-   Irritable

### The APGAR Score

It is an objective method of quantifying the newborn's condition. And is useful for conveying
information about the newborn's overall status and response to resuscitation

|                 | 0            | 1                         | 2                                       |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Heart Rate**  | 0            | \<100                     | \>=100                                  |
| **Respiration** | 0            | Weak or Irregular         | Good Cry                                |
| **Reaction**    | None         | Slight                    | Good                                    |
| **Colour**      | Blue or Pale | Pink body <br> limbs blue | All pink                                |
| **Tone**        | Limp         | Some movement             | Active movement, <br> limbs well flexed |

: The APGAR Score

8-10 = No Asphyxia\
5-7 = Mild Asphyxia\
3-4 = Moderate Asphyxia\
0-2 = Severe Asphyxia\

### Management

-   Largely supportive
-   Newborn resuscitation/oxygenation
-   Correction of fluid & electrolyte imbalances including shock
-   Control of seizures
-   Treatment of any underlying infection
-   Look out for birth injuries
-   Active cooling found to improve neurological outcome
-   Temperature maintenance
-   Full Blood Count, Culture & Sensitivity, Blood glucose etc
-   Serum electrolytes: Na, K, Ca & Mg
-   Start empiric 1st line antibiotics according to protocol: / X'pen & Gentamycin
-   Start IV Fluids at 50ml/kg (Plain 10% Dextrose).
-   Pass a urethral catheter and monitor the baby's urine output.
-   The target temperature of the baby is 36.50C -- 37.50C

### Hypoxemic Ischaemic Encephalopathy

-   The most important consequence of birth asphyxia is
-   The outcome ranges from complete recovery to death
-   25 - 30% end up with permanent damage like Cerebral palsy & Mental retardation
-   Prognosis dependent on gestational age, management of metabolic & cardiopulmonary complications
    & the severity of the encephalopathy
-   Subsequent competent care and available facilities also influence the outcome

## Birth Injuries

A birth injury can simply be referred to as any form of damage incurred by the baby during the
birthing process. Injury may occur as a result of inappropriate or deficient medical skill or
attention or may occur despite skilled and competent obstetric care.

Predisposing conditions include:

-   Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) / Small maternal stature / Primiparity
-   Macrosomia
-   Shoulder Dystocia
-   Prematurity
-   Prolonged or precipitous labour
-   Abnormal presentation
-   Instrumentation
-   Handling after delivery

### Fracture

Generally, the affected limb looks deformed or swollen, and the baby barely moves it on account of
pain

#### Clavicle 

This is the most fractured bone during delivery; mostly during delivery of the shoulder in vertex
and of the extended arms in the breech. Signs of a fracture may include no free arm movement on the
affected side, crepitus and bony irregularity, and absent Moro reflex. It has an excellent
prognosis, even though it is commonly missed. Treatment, if any, includes immobilization of the arm
and shoulder as shown below.

This is the first type of humeral fracture

#### Humerus

The x-ray below shows another commonly fractured bone, the humerus.

#### Femur

Risk factors: big baby, breech presentation, incompetency. The affected thigh looks deformed,
swollen and may be reddened. The main mode of management involves splinting the limb from the waist
to below the knee.
