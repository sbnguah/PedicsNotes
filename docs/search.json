If the stress has been going on for a while and the fetus has been passing meconium for a few days, the cord, skin and nails may be stained. Occurs when the fetus passes meconium into the surrounding liquor and then aspirates this into the lungs. Tends to happen in term and post-date babies. Distressed fetuses tend to pass meconium either just before or during the delivery process. The smaller the amniotic fluid volume, and the more meconium the baby passes, the thicker the fluid and the more dangerous it becomes if aspirated.\nHistory of Pregnancy and delivery looking for predisposing factors such as fetal distress, post-maturity, meconium-stained liquor etc. Physical examination looking for signs of meconium-staining on the baby, and evidence of respiratory distress (fast breathing, chest indrawing, cyanosis etc.). Investigations include FBC, Blood C&S, and sometimes a chest X-ray depending on the severity. Management is mainly supportive. Includes antibiotics, respiratory support, supportive treatment, IVFs and nutrition.\n\n\n6.8.2 Transient tachypnoea of the newborn\nCaused by delay in clearance of fetal lung fluid.

The history and physical examination are essential in the overall approach to the patient. Prenatal, perinatal and postnatal history play a huge role in neonatal assessments They guide and inform the health worker on the most appropriate investigations, which would eventually lead to a correct diagnosis. A complete history may unmask the likely cause of symptoms and guide further questioning, for example, sepsis.\nExamination on the other hand involves assessing the Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Random Blood Sugar, provision of Oxygen and checking Oxygen saturation. This can be pre- and post-ductal. Others include temperature checks and other vital signs. The weight, current weight, head circumference, and length. Intravenous access should be obtained for possible further treatment. Appropriate investigations should also be done.\nRequisite investigations should also be done accordingly."

Surfactants are essential for reducing the surface area of the lungs, thus helping in breathing. Incidence and severity increase with decreasing gestational age. Other risk factors include prematurity, male gender, multiple gestations, being born to a mother with diabetes mellitus and hypothermia. Signs of RDS include tachypnea, grunting, recessions and cyanosis. Prevention involves preventing preterm births and administering corticosteroids to the mother of gestation between 24 to 34 weeks before delivery. Treatment however involves the administration of surfactant.\nNote that this condition is different from Respiratory Distress in a newborn. Respiratory distress is a more generalised term used as a single or a combination of signs as a result of increased work of breathing. It can result from pulmonary as well as non-pulmonary causes. These include cardiac, neurological (eg. Asphyxia), haematological (Anemia) and sepsis. It occurs in both term and preterm children."

In the newborn period, it is defined as a random blood glucose of &lt; 2.6mmol/l. Risk factors include sepsis, Infant of a diabetic mother, prematurity, Intrauterine growth restriction, birth asphyxia and hypothermia. Signs include Lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, and apnea. Neurological damage may result from hypoglycemia in neonates.\nNeonatal hypoglycemia is most commonly seen in macrosomic infants and infants of diabetic mothers. For these babies, during pregnancy, maternal glucose crosses the placenta to cause fetal hyperglycaemia. The fetal pancreas responds by increasing insulin production. Following delivery, the hyperglycaemic stimulus is instantly removed but insulin production may take longer to slow down. This results in an increased risk and incidence of hypoglycemia at the early newborn period.\nManagement involves initially checking the airway, breathing and circulation. 2ml/kg of IV 10% Dextrose or 5ml/kg of 5% Dextrose may be given PR if IV access is unavailable. Ensure the baby has a normal body temperature (temperature target: 36.50 – 37.50C) as hypothermia prone the baby to hypoglycaemia. Always look for the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia and treat it appropriately."

    "text": "7.6 Neonatal Sepsis\nSepsis in the neonate kills more than a million babies worldwide every year. It is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs of infection with accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life. It can be categorized into Early Onset Neonatal Sepsis (EOS), which refers to the presence of signs of infection accompanied by a positive culture within the first 72 hours of life, and Late Onset Neonatal Sepsis (LOS), which signifies the onset of signs of infection with a positive culture after 72 hours of life.\nCausative organisms: Early-onset sepsis is typically caused by organisms from the maternal genital tract, whereas late-onset sepsis is caused by organisms in the caregiving environment or community. Common organisms are Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus among others. For many of these organisms, the resistance rate to antibiotics is alarmingly going up.\nAntenal risk factors known to be associated with neonatal jaundice include spontaneous rupture of membranes, less than 37 completed weeks of gestation, spontaneous preterm labour, rupture of membranes greater than 18 hours before delivery, maternal chorioamnionitis, maternal fever of 38 degrees Celsius or more, maternal invasive bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, pre-labour rupture of membranes, Group B Streptococcus infection in a previous baby, or current pregnancy, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and foul-smelling liquor.\nPostnatally, risk factors for neonatal sepsis include prolonged resuscitation at birth, prematurity, invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation, excessive handling, home delivery, lack of hand washing and inadequate Infection prevention control. Others include overcrowding and prolonged hospital stay.\nSigns of neonatal sepsis include\n\nAbnormal colour: Pale, cyanotic, mottled appearance, jaundice, grey\nTemperature instability\nAbdominal signs: distension, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhoea\nRespiratory: Apnea, respiratory distress, gasping (Abnormal breathing)\nHypo - or hyperglycemia\nCardiovascular: Shock, tachycardia (HR &gt; 180), Bradycardia (HR &lt; 80)\nAbnormal bleeding\nCentral Nervous System: Excessive crying, irritability, seizures, altered tone, lethargy,\n\nManagement of neonatal sepsis should be comprehensive. It should include an initial evaluation for resuscitation of the airway, breathing and circulation. Further, the blood sugar should be measured. Early reversal of the shock state by administering an initial bolus of 10ml/kg of crystalloid or its equivalent should be done in the shock present. Vasopressors or inotropes should be used in septic shock only after appropriate volume resuscitation has been done. The goals of the resuscitation should be Normal Cap refill (less than 2 seconds), normal pulses, warm extremities, and appropriate urine output (greater than 1mL/kg/hr).\nIncreased successful treatment of neonatal sepsis requires early recognition and urgent administration of appropriate antibiotics.\nAfter resuscitation, ongoing management usually starts with a detailed history to assess risk factors and other presentations. A thorough physical examination will then be performed, looking for and documenting specific signs indicating severity.\nInvestigations usually include a blood culture. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Ideally, a culture should always be done before the first dose of antibiotics. Other auxiliary investigations include a complete blood count, blood gases, urine culture, and a lumbar puncture. The threshold for performing a lumber puncture in all symptomatic newborns suspected of sepsis should be encouraged. It should however be deferred in neonates considered too unstable to tolerate the procedure, or where there is an absolute contraindication.\nSupportive treatment is essential for a good outcome in neonatal sepsis. Antibiotics are not the entire solution to their treatment. Nutrition or breastfeeding should be optimized. The environment should be thermo-neutral and oxygen saturation should be maintained within the normal range (89 – 95%). Intravenous fluids should be used if the infant is hemodynamically unstable. Monitoring of the blood glucose levels should be instituted. Packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma should be used in the event of anaemia or bleeding."

Out of 10 term and 10 preterm newborns, 6 and 8 will develop jaundice respectively, all in the 1st couple of weeks of life. Universally accepted as one of the commonest causes of admission and readmission in the first month of life. At Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital Mother Baby Unit, monthly admissions average between 300 and 400 and about 15 to 25% of all these admissions are cases of neonatal jaundice. Whereas the developed world describes kernicterus as a rare condition, unfortunately, the same cannot be said for us in developing countries. On average, cases of severe Neonatal Jaundice have ranged from 2.2% to 30.8% of all jaundice cases, with the monthly mortality ranging from 2.8% to 15.2%(REFERENCE).

    "text": "8.2 Bilirubin metabolism\nHumans continuously form bilirubin and the liver is the main organ responsible for the metabolism of bilirubin. For every gram of haemoglobin, 35mg of bilirubin is produced. The bilirubin is conjugated by the UGT enzyme, making it water-soluble, which is then released into the bile before being excreted in the stool (and urine). It can also be broken down in the intestine by bacterial enzymes like E. coli. However, at birth, the newborn has several challenges. The liver is immature, and the levels of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) enzyme are low. Newborns have β-glucuronidase in the intestinal mucosa/brush border, which deconjugates the conjugated bilirubin found in the meconium. The unconjugated bilirubin can now be reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and recycled back into the circulation. This process is known as the “enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin”. The gut is sterile and, subsequently, infants have far fewer bacteria in the gut, and so very little, if any, bilirubin is reduced to urobilin and stercobilin.\nSpecifically in newborns, more bilirubin is produced, on account of the short life span of Red Blood Cells and high Hemoglobin levels. The liver is immature. They also have fewer bacteria and low intestinal enzymatic activity in the intestine"

    "text": "8.4 Types of Jaundice\nThere are two main types of jaundice:\n\n\nPhysiological jaundice and\nPathological jaundice.\n\nThere are three main mechanisms for jaundice:\n\n\nIncreased bilirubin production\nDecreased bilirubin clearance and\nIncreased enterohepatic circulation.\n\n\n8.4.1 Physiological jaundice\n\n8.4.1.1 Increased bilirubin production\nin term newborn infants, bilirubin production is 2 to 3 times higher than in adults. This occurs because newborns have more RBCs and fetal RBCs have a shorter life span than those in adults. Unfortunately, the liver being immature, cannot conjugate and excrete all the bilirubin from the breakdown of all the excess RBCs, thereby resulting in spillover of bilirubin into the blood.\n\n\n8.4.1.2 Bilirubin clearance or excretion\nThis is decreased in newborns, mainly due to the low levels of the UGT enzyme in the liver. UGT activity in term infants at day 7 of age is approximately 1% of that of the adult liver and does not reach adult levels until about 14 weeks of age.\n\n\n8.4.1.3 Enterohepatic circulation\nThe presence of the ß-glucuronidase results in an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, further increasing the bilirubin load in the infant. This is a diagnosis of exclusion\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Pathological jaundice\n\n8.4.2.1 Definition\nNeonatal jaundice is said to be pathologic if:\n\nJaundice in the 1st 24 - 48 hours of life.\nRate of SB rise &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (8.5µmol/L) per hour\nJaundice all over the body (including palms & soles)\nPresence of a danger sign\nHistory of previous siblings having had jaundice at birth\nJaundice in a term newborn after 2 weeks of age or in a preterm infant after 3 weeks of age\nDirect (conjugated) bilirubin concentration &gt; 20% of the total\n\nIt can be caused by certain pathologic conditions or exaggeration of the mechanisms responsible for physiologic neonatal jaundice. Identification of what is causing the jaundice is useful in guiding management, including counselling of the parents and what to expect for the next pregnancy. Most common cause is increased bilirubin production due to haemolytic disease processes that include the following:\n\nIsoimmune-mediated haemolysis (e.g., ABO or Rhesus D incompatibility)\nErythrocyte enzymatic defects, e.g. G6PD deficiency\nSepsis, especially Urinary Tract Infection\nPolycythaemia\nBirth Injuries resulting in sequestration of blood within a closed space, e.g. cephalohematoma, subgaleal bleed.\n\n\n\n8.4.2.2 ABO incompatibility\nThis is one of the most common causes of isoimmune hemolytic disease during the neonatal period. Infants with blood group A or B, carried by blood group O mother, will have a positive antibody because of maternal anti-A or anti-B transfer into the fetal circulation.\n\n\n8.4.2.3 Rhesus Incompatibility\nRh incompatibility can occur when an Rh-negative pregnant mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells secondary to feto-maternal haemorrhage during pregnancy/delivery. As a result, the mother’s blood gets exposed to the fetal circulation and sensitization occurs leading to maternal antibody production against the foreign Rh antigen. Once produced, maternal Rh (IgG) antibodies may cross freely from the placenta to the fetal circulation, where they form antigen-antibody complexes with Rh- positive fetal RBCs and eventually are destroyed, resulting in a fetal alloimmune-induced hemolytic anaemia and jaundice. The first pregnancy is usually not affected, but more antibodies are produced with each pregnancy making the jaundice worse with each pregnancy.\n\n\n8.4.2.4 Decreased clearance\nInherited defects in the gene that encodes the UGT liver enzyme (eg, Gilbert Syndrome), decrease bilirubin conjugation (eg Crigglar Najjar). In physiological jaundice, the levels are naturally low, but here, in addition to the low levels the UGT enzyme is either defective, absent or has a reduced function. This reduces hepatic bilirubin metabolism and its clearance thereby increasing the total serum unconjugated bilirubin levels.\n\n\n8.4.2.5 Increased enterohepatic circulation\nThe major causes are\n\n\nBreastfeeding jaundice\nBreast milk jaundice\nImpaired intestinal motility is caused by functional or anatomic obstruction.\nCongenital hypothyroidism also causes increased enterohepatic circulation on account of reduced gut motility."

The dose in turn is determined by:\n\nThe wavelength of the light\nThe intensity of the light (irradiance)\nThe distance between the light and the baby\nThe body’s surface area is exposed to the light.\n\nEffective phototherapy lowers serum bilirubin levels by converting the lipid-soluble bilirubin into water-soluble forms that can easily be excreted in the stool and urine Phototherapy also prevents the need for an Exchange Blood Transfusion and prevents bilirubin from depositing in the brain. The breakdown of bilirubin begins almost instantaneously when the skin is exposed to light, hence, phototherapy should be started as early as possible.\nIn initiating phototherapy, always note the time the baby’s SBR sample is being taken and estimate the age in hours up until that time. Interpret bilirubin levels according to the baby’s postnatal age in hours and manage the bilirubin levels according to the threshold table Start phototherapy if the SBR plots on or above the line appropriate for age (in hours) and gestational age If the SBR plots just underneath the line, repeat the SBR after 6 hours or start phototherapy if a repeat is not feasible. Repeat the SBR at least 24 to 48 hours after initiation of phototherapy. Discontinue phototherapy when the SBR plots below the line.\nThe side effects of phototherapy include:\n\nIncrease insensible water loss\nLoose stools\nSkin rash\nBronze baby syndrome\nHypo- or Hyperthermia\nInterruption of mother-baby bonding\n\n\n\n8.7.3 Sunlight Therapy\nWorks for physiological jaundice, however, one can never tell by looking at a baby what kind of jaundice a baby has Err on the side of caution, at least always have the SBR checked first Remember prolonged exposure to UV rays can be harmful to the developing skin Baby cannot be put in the light for more than 30 minutes in a day Even most of the available literature and studies that recommend sunlight still advice that if the jaundice is severe, the baby must be managed in the hospital!! A serum bilirubin high enough to warrant treatment should be managed in the hospital.\n\n\n8.7.4 Exchange Blood Transfusion\nProvides a means of rapid reduction of circulating bilirubin in the blood. Involves manual removal of the baby’s blood and simultaneously replacing it with compatible donor blood.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Exchange Blood Transfusion\n\n\nIn addition to reducing bilirubin levels, EBT removes partially hemolyzed RBCs, RBCs coated with antibodies and circulating immunoglobulins.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Bilirubin Graph (&gt; 38 weeks)\n\n\nComplications of exchange blood transfusion include:\n\nCardiac & respiratory disorders\nShock due to bleeding or inadequate replacement of blood infection\nCatheter-related complications\nChanges in the composition of the blood (high or low potassium, low calcium, low glucose, changes in pH)\nThrombocytopenia\nAnd the rare but serious complications of air embolism, portal hypertension, and necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\n\n\n8.7.5 Intravenous Immunoglobins\nTreatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been suggested as an alternative therapy to Exchange Blood Transfusion for isoimmune hemolytic jaundice to reduce the need for Exchange Blood Transfusion and duration of phototherapy and hospitalization in isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn. It has been proposed that IVIG blocks the binding of the antibody to the antigen. With this blockade, hemolysis no longer occurs."

Internally, the right and left atria are separated by the tricuspid and mitral valves from the right and left ventricles respectively. The arterial supply of the heart is through the coronary arteries while venous drainage is through the coronary sinus. The aorta and pulmonary arteries arise from the left and right ventricles. The heart has three layers:\n\nEndocardium: Inner epithelial layer of the heart\nMyocardium: Muscular part of the heart\nPericardium: Outer layers of the heart. Divided into the visceral and parietal pericardium.\n\nVenous blood enters the right atrium through the inferior and superior vena cavae. It empties in atrial systole into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. It then moves on through the pulmonary valve in ventricular systole, to the pulmonary artery and then the lungs. Blood returning from the lungs enters the left atrium through the four pulmonary veins. In atrial systole, it moves into the left ventricle through the mitral valve. Finally, it empties into the aorta through the aortic valve."

Also, both systolic and diastolic pressures in the aorta are higher than that in the pulmonary artery.\nSystolic pressure in general is generated by the ventricles. In conditions such as coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, the ventricles increase their workload to generate enough pressure. The diastolic pressure on the other hand is maintained by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves.

These are adaptations to using the placenta rather than the lungs for oxygenation. These shunts are the ductus venosus, ductus arteriosus and patent foramen. At birth, these shunts regress. The ductus venosus regresses quickly to form the ligamentum arteriosus. The foramen ovale closes at birth physiologically but may take years to close anatomically. The patent ductus arteriosus closes soon after birth but can physiologically stay open for 72 hours. Beyond this period it is considered to be pathologic if it continues to stay open. Patent ductus arteriosus are quite common in preterm newborns."

They form about 85% of all pediatric heart diseases seen in the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH). It is further divided into:\n\nAcyanotic: These are congenital heart diseases that are traditionally not known to be associated with cyanosis. Examples include ventricular septal defect (VSD), Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)\nCyanotic: These on the other hand are associated with cyanosis and include Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), Truncus Arteriosus and Tricuspid Atresia.\n\nAcquired heart disorders: These are heart conditions that are not present at birth but develop afterwards. They include Infective Endocarditis (IE), Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and Endomyocardial Fibrosis (EMF)\nRhythm disorders: This set of disorders can present as either congenital or acquired. They affect the electrical system of the heart leading to an increase in heart rate (tachyarrhythmia), decrease in heart rate (bradyarrhythmia) or even normal heart rate.\nSecondary cardiac disorders: Some pathologies tend to affect the heart as a complication. Such conditions include some glycogen storage disorders resulting in cardiomyopathy and Rheumatoid arthritis resulting in pericardial effusion."

    "text": "15.1 History\nThe history is traditionally divided into:\n\n15.1.1 Prenatal\nPrenatally, the history should delve into but not be limited to the following:\n\nInfections: Some infections are the well-known TORCHES. They include Toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, parvovirus B19 (fifth disease), varicella (chickenpox) and (Zika), Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus. Rubella when acquired in the first trimester of pregnancy is very well known to be associated with PDAs.\nMedications: The use of some medications, including herbs predisposes to heart disease in newborns. Anticonvulsant such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are highly teratogenic.(Kalisch-Smith, Ved, and Sparrow 2019)\nRecreational drugs: Excessive smoking, cocaine, and alcohol use in early pregnancy are all associated with teratogenic effects on the heart.\nMaternal illnesses: Maternal medical conditions during pregnancy may be associated with heart diseases in their fetuses. Diabetes mellitus is particularly well known, predisposing to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, d-TGA, etc. Autoimmune conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus may also predispose to rhythm disturbances in the fetus and child, even when the mother is not symptomatic.\nFamily history of CHD: The recurrence of CHD in first-degree relatives varies but is almost always higher than the rest of the population. For instance, having a first-degree relation with a cornoventricular defect was associated with a recurrence risk ratio of 24.3 (95% CI,12.2 to 48.7), 7.1 (95% CI, 4.5 to 11.1) for isolated ASD, and 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.3) for isolated VSD.(Øyen et al. 2009)\n\n\n\n15.1.2 Perinatal\nPerinatal history associated with heart disease may include the following:\n\nBirth weight: A high birth weight, often associated with a child of a diabetic mother is also associated with an increased incidence of CHDs. Conversely, a low birth weight may also be associated with fetal alcohol syndrome or congenital rubella syndrome, both of which are associated with CHDs.\nNewborn resuscitation: Some critical CHDs can be similar to neonatal asphyxia in a newborn, thus requiring resuscitation.\n\n\n\n15.1.3 After birth\nAscertaining history after birth is the most extensive. Many of these are directed to the features of heart failure. These include:\n\nGrowth failure: Poor weight gain is a very prominent feature of CHDs in children. Many clinically significant CHDs result in poor feeding, chronic metabolic demand on the patient and poor oxygenation in cyanotic CHDs. All these results in increased caloric demand, resulting in poor growth.\nCyanotic spells: Some cyanotic CHDs are associated with recurrent periods where the child has increasing cyanosis, sometimes associated with weakness, fast breathing and even unconsciousness. The presence of these spells may be pointed to a CHD.\nSquatting and exercise intolerance: A common presentation of heart diseases in children is exercise intolerance. However, for some cyanotic congenital heart diseases, most notably ToF, the added feature is frequent squatting when the child becomes fatigued.\nDelayed milestones: Growth failure, easy fatiguability and the presence of other genetic syndromes may result in delayed motor milestones in the child.\nOthers: Fast and sometimes difficulty breathing are also common presentations of CHDs. Some children develop oedema. This is predominantly seen in the faces of younger children and the feet of older children. Frequent lower respiratory infection is also seen in children with heart diseases, especially those associated with heart failure.\nUncommon symptoms: Uncommon presentation of heart disease in children include:\n\nChest pain is a rather feared symptom in adults but usually portends another diagnosis rather than heart disease in children.\nSyncope can be observed in children with an arrhythmia, or left or right ventricular obstruction. However, this is still not a common presentation in pediatric heart diseases.\nOlder children report palpitations.\nJoint swelling does occur in Rheumatic Heart Disease but again not a common presentation in children with a heart pathology."

One should first look out for life-threatening signs and intervene quickly. Subsequent steps could include:\n\nNutritional status is very important as many children with chronic heart conditions with significant heart failure present with malnutrition. The growth pattern of the patient should always be evaluated.\nDysmorphism is very critical in pediatric heart diseases. As much as 23% of all children with CHD will have a chromosomal abnormality.(Wang et al. 2023) There are many genetic syndromes with well-documented recognisable heart defects. Below are just a few adapted from Ko (2015):\n\nCommon genetic syndromes associated with congenital heart diseases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic syndrome\n% with CHD\nCardiac anomalies\n\n\n\n\nDown Syndrome\n40 to 50\nAtrial Septal Defect, Ventricular Septal Defect, Atrioventricular Canal Defect, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n\nTurner syndrome\n25 to 45\nCoarctation of the Aorta.

Cyanosis, the blueish duskiness of the skin and mucous membranes can be seen in children with a cyanotic congenital heart disease. In black skin, this may be difficult and can only be observed in the mouth and tongue (Figure 15.1). Mild cyanosis is often not visible and may require the use of pulse oximetry. Pallor can be observed in patients with CHDs. or in other AHDs such as infective endocarditis. Jaundice can be observed in patients with Infective Endocarditis or those with hepatic injury secondary to chronic heart failure.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Cyanosis in the tongue of a child\n\n\n\nClubbing: All four stages of digital clubbing are seen in children with cyanotic CHD or Infective endocarditis. (Figure 15.2) Note that some cases of finger clubbing may be familial.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: Finger clubbing\n\n\n\nRespiratory signs: Respiratory signs commonly associated with heart diseases in children are tachypnoea, dyspnoea, chest recessions and increased work of breathing. These are especially true when there is associated heart failure and worsens with exercise or breastfeeding the the breastfeeding infant."

Examples are:\n\nCardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive and hypertrophic)\nMyocarditis\nArrhythmias\nCoronary artery anomalies\nPost-op cardiac dysfunction\n\nVolume overload: This occurs in conditions associated with increased volume (preload) in the heart especially the ventricles. The ventricle must therefore eject an increased blood volume, leading to tachycardia. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. Examples include:\n\nVentricular septal defect (left to right shunt)\nAtrial septal defect\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nAortic regurgitation (left ventricle)\nMitral regurgitation (Left atrium)\n\nPressure overload: This is when heart failure is caused by an increased pressure (afterload) in the heart. Ventricles must therefore contract against higher pressures. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. These include:\n\nHypertension\nAortic valve stenosis\nPulmonary stenosis\nCoarctation of the aorta\n\n\nIn all these, the result is decreased cardiac output and pulmonary oedema."

Heart transplantation is the last option in some cases of heart failure.\n\n\n16.7.2 Pharmacological treatment\nTreatment depends on the clinical presentation and cause of the heart failure. There are 2 main groups to be considered:\n\n\n16.7.3 Acute decompensated heart failure\n\nDrugs used in acute decompensated heart failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\nAction\n\n\n\n\nDiuretics\nNotable here is furosemide. The aim is to help decongest the lungs, reduce preload by vasodilatation and improve heart failure symptoms.\n\n\nInotropes\nThese include adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine and dobutamine. They help improve the contractility of the heart, increase heart rate, and increase peripheral vascular resistance, thus maintaining the blood pressure and cardiac output. They are usually Intravenous medications.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.7.4 Chronic heart failure\nThese are usually oral medications given to treat heart failure on an outpatient basis\n\nDrugs for chronic heart failure treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nAction\n\n\n\n\nDiuretics\nThese are given to decongest the lungs, liver and other edematous organs. The most commonly used is furosemide.\n\n\nAldosterone antagonists\nThese counteract the aldosterone effect of water and sodium retention. They decrease afterload while helping in reversing cardiac remodelling.\n\n\nACE-I/ARB\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers counteract the renin effects of increasing afterload. They thus decrease the afterload and help reverse and prevent cardiac remodelling\n\n\nDigoxin\nThis is probably the oldest anti-heart failure medication. It has negative chronotropic and positive inotropic effects. Thus increasing contractility and reducing heart rate."

    "text": "18.2 Pathophysiology\nTypically VSD without the presence of another congenital heart malformation results in a left to right ventricle shunting lesion because of the pressure difference. Thus, a VSD is usually an acyanotic congenital heart lesion. This leads to a volume overload of the pulmonary artery, lungs, left atrium and left ventricle. These chambers subsequently dilated. Pulmonary edema develops from lung congestion leading to signs of heart failure.\nSecondly, depending on the size of the defect the pressure in the left ventricle will get transmitted to the right. How much pressure is transmitted depends on the size of the defect with bigger defects transmitting more than smaller ones. This can result in increased right ventricular pressure, and hypertrophy. It also worsens the pulmonary oedema already mentioned above.\nPersistent pressure and volume overload cause remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in permanent changes and pulmonary hypertension. When the pulmonary pressure rises significantly higher than the systemic pressure, a reversal of the shunt results, leading to decreased oxygen saturation."

    "text": "38.2 Ways of measuring blood pressure\n\nDirect intra-arterial measurements by placing a catheter into the vessel and measuring the pressure “in line” with the vessel (end-on-pressure). This method is used by physiologists and Intensivists. The principle is employed in the measurements of central venous pressure and intracranial pressure in clinical practice.\nThe auscultatory method is done with the use of a sphygmomanometer (either mercury or aneroid) and a stethoscope. This is the gold standard in clinical practice. Korotkoff sounds 1 and 5 sounds are measured for systolic and diastolic bleed pressures respectively. Values obtained are generally lower than direct & oscillometric measurements.\nThe palpation method (flush technique) is performed with the use of a sphygmomanometer and palpating finger. Largely unreliable. Only systolic blood pressure can be measured with this technique. The palpated pulse is generally lower than Korotkoff sound 1 by 10mmHg.\nThe oscillometric method uses a sphygmomanometer and a monitor e.g. digital blood pressure devices and Dynamap. Here, pulsatile blood flow through arterial wall oscillations is transmitted to the cuff encircling the extremity. Korotkoff sound 1 is recorded at the point of rapid increase in oscillation amplitude. Korotkoff sound 5 is recorded as the point of a sudden decrease in oscillation amplitude. Values obtained by oscillometric measurements are generally higher than auscultatory.\nDoppler ultrasound technique: Here a Doppler ultrasound is held over the pulse to magnify the sound so that it is audible without a stethoscope. The sound detected may be 5mmHg higher than Korotkoff sound 1.\nAmbulatory blood pressure measurements. Here, multiple measurements are recorded over time (e.g. 24 hours) with digital devices attached to the limb whilst the patient engages in normal activities outside the hospital. Results are analysed on a computer or paper tracer built into the device using the mean of the readings. It provides a truer picture of blood pressure trends useful in diagnosing “white coat hypertension” and nocturnal hypertension (absence of a normal physiological drop in blood pressure during sleep)."

It is believed to cause endothelial dysfunction leading to microvascular and inflammatory injury to the kidneys. There are also reduced levels of endothelial-derived nitric oxide and associated elevation of the Renin-Aldosterone-Angiotensin System. Elevated uric acid levels in hypertensive individuals are associated with adverse outcomes like stroke. Allopurinol treatment is advocated for such individuals."

    "text": "38.15 Hypertensive encephalopathy\nHypertension with changes in mental status and/or seizures. Other manifestations are:\n\nFacial palsy\nVisual changes→blindness\nComa\n\nPathophysiology: Disruption of the normal autoregulatory mechanisms of cerebral blood flow. The inability of cerebral vasculature to constrict appropriately in response to the abrupt increase in cerebral blood flow leads to cerebral hyperperfusion. Generally, short-acting antihypertensives are preferred in the initial instance of treatment so that any potentially harmful drop in blood pressure (which could lead to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome {PRES}) could be reversed. Subsequently, long-acting agents could be used Sublingual nifedipine could cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure so it is best avoided or should be used with extreme caution\nTreatment outline:\n\nUse anti-hypertensive drugs\nBlood pressure should be brought down slowly to a desirable level (?stage I) by 48hrs (though not to normal levels) as follows:\n\n1/3 of total blood pressure reduction in 1st 12-hrs\nNext one-third of the subsequent 12-hrs\nFinal one-third over 24-hrs\n\nAlternatively, by a quarter within 6 hours, and the rest in the next 24-36hrs\n\nCommonly preferred drugs include Labetalol infusion, Na nitroprusside infusion, and IV hydralazine infusion. After achieving the desired blood pressure target, oral antihypertensives are then started"
