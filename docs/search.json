    "text": "Preface\nMedical knowledge has evolved tremendously over the past century. With the advent of the internet, sharing medical knowledge has become very easy. However, most medical literature available originates from developed countries, thus devoid of the relevant local content for many underdeveloped regions. This is critical for medical education and practice in that these texts often do not consider the cultural relevance of these pathologies, disease patterns and risks, local treatment options and idiosyncrasies of the medical delivery systems. Undoubtedly, these have significant effects on medical education and practice.\nThis text was birthed out of the need to bridge this gap. Though the content is primarily directed at undergraduate medical teaching, it can be beneficial to postgraduate trainees as well.",

    "text": "5.1 Background\nIn resource-limited resource settings, such as those lacking access to healthcare staff, equipment, and resources, pediatric emergency and critical care (PECC) play an essential role. These settings bear the highest burden of severe acute illness and life-threatening injuries. Still, due to underappreciation of its importance, critical care has not been incorporated as an essential part of the health system.(Sakaan et al. 2022)\nAn infant, child, or adolescent with an illness, injury, or post-operative state that increases the risk for or results in acute physiological instability (abnormal vital signs, laboratory values, or clinical findings) falls under acute paediatric critical illness.(Appiah et al. 2018)\n\nMany paediatric lives can be saved with low-cost resuscitation techniques and procedures, supportive care and referral pathways available at all levels of care. Over sixty per cent of children die because of poor emergency and critical care. SDG may not be achieved unless PECC service is available to every acutely ill child.\nBy providing prompt and adequate medical care to critically ill children, paediatric emergency and critical care services can contribute to a decrease in childhood death rates.",

    "text": "5.2 Reasons for PECC\nChildren who require specialised care due to severe diseases or injuries should ideally be referred or managed at the paediatric emergency or critical care (PICU). Any space available should and can be used to offer such services. In that sense, any clinician can advocate for or institute measures to provide PECC.\nThe following are typical reasons for PICU admissions:\n\nAcute respiratory distress and failure e.g., (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, severe exacerbations of asthma, or any cause are all considered respiratory distress.\nShock: hypovolemic shock, septic shock, (e.g., from severe dehydration or haemorrhage). cardiogenic shock (e.g., from myocarditis or heart failure),\nTrauma: accidental and non-accidental polytrauma injuries, burns, or other causes.\nNeurological emergencies: Seizures, severe brain damage, cerebral bleeding, meningitis, or encephalitis are examples.\nCardiovascular: Heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and exacerbations of congenital heart disease are examples.\nSepsis: Systemic infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi that result in septic shock or sepsis.\nMetabolic disorders include metabolic acidosis, severe electrolyte imbalances, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and inborn metabolic abnormalities.\nConditions that result in the failure or dysfunction of numerous organ systems, including multiple organ failure, are called multi-organ dysfunction.\nPost-operative support: Children undergoing difficult procedures, especially those requiring close cardiovascular monitoring of organ function.\nHaematological and oncological disorders: coagulation issues, thrombocytopenia, or severe anaemia, side effects of cancer treatment, such as tumour lysis syndrome or neutropenia caused by chemotherapy.\nExposure to poisonous substances, overdosing, or poisoning are examples of toxicological emergencies.\nEndocrine: include thyroid storm, adrenal crises, and diabetic emergencies.\nGastrointestinal: intussusception, typhoid ileal perforation, necrotizing enterocolitis, or extreme dehydration are examples of.\nRenal disorders: include electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney damage, and renal failure.",

    "text": "5.3 Evaluation of critically ill\nA methodical and comprehensive approach is necessary when evaluating a severely unwell child to promptly recognize and treat life-threatening diseases. The clinical plan that is frequently applied in emergency and critical care settings for children:\nInitial assessment and stabilisation\nABCDE technique: This methodical technique entails evaluating the airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure.\nA – check for airway patency. Determine at risk or not at risk of obstruction.\nB – the breathing sufficient\nC – assess circulation for perfusion\nD – evaluate the neurological status using GCS or AVPU\nE – expose the infant while keeping them warm.\n\n\nVital Signs: Take your blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, oxygen saturation and pain score assessment.\nDuring this assessment, any irregularities ought to be taken care of right away before the next category is done.\n\n5.3.1 History\nA focused history that covers the child’s presenting complaints, medical history, current medications, recent illnesses, immunization status, and events leading up to the current presentation should be obtained from caregivers.\nInquire about symptoms like fever, coughing, breathing problems diarrhoeaa, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, trauma, or toxin intake.\n\n\n5.3.2 Physical examination\nExamine the child thoroughly, beginning with a general assessment of their look and state of consciousness.\nPerform a comprehensive examination from head to toe, encompassing evaluation of the respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, abdominal, cardiovascular, renal, and musculoskeletal systems.\nKeep an eye out for symptoms of trauma, dehydration, altered mental status, cyanosis, irregular breath sounds, abnormal heart sounds, and respiratory distress.\n\n\n5.3.3 Focused assessment and investigations\n\nPrioritize testing including blood tests (e.g., complete blood count, electrolytes, blood gas analysis), imaging studies (e.g., chest X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan), and\nother tests (e.g., ECG, echocardiogram, lumbar puncture) based on the first assessment and history.\nIf available and appropriate, take into consideration bedside testing such as point-of-care ultrasound or quick diagnostics for infectious disorders.\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Management and treatment\nBased on the results of the diagnostic tests and clinical findings, begin the necessary treatment. This can involve the use of supportive care measures, oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, and drug delivery (such as antibiotics, inotropes, analgesia and sedatives).\nPrioritize treating life-threatening disorders including shock, respiratory failure, and obstruction of the airway.\n\n\n5.3.5 Monitoring and reassessment\nMonitoring is a cardinally important part of critical care. It allows for evaluation of the patient’s response to interventions. Patients with critical illness or injury require more frequent monitoring in the first 24-48 to identify deterioration patients or those not responding to treatment. Keep a close eye on the child’s vital signs, reaction to therapies, and general state of health.\nRegularly reevaluate the child and modify the management plan in response to treatment response and changes in the child’s clinical status. If resources permit all patients should be on patient monitor for continuous vital signs evaluation. Additional staffing may be required or assigned to monitor and alert other clinicians of abnormal values. This will ensure a timely response.\n\n\n5.3.6 Multi-disciplinary and referral\nCritical illness may involve or result or lead to multiple pathologies as a result multidisciplinary team approach to care cannot be over-emphasised. If additional evaluation and management are needed, consult with the appropriate specialists (paediatric surgeons, paediatric intensivists, neurologists, infectious disease specialists, etc.).\nMDT in critical care involves discussing patients in detail with the appropriate specialist(s) to determine the best care for the desired outcome. If the child’s condition calls for specialized interventions or resources not provided by the current facility, consider transferring to a higher level of care.\n\n\n5.3.7 Family centred care\nThe family’s role in providing care for a sick child must always be considered during management. Recall that the patient is best known by their parents, guardians, or relatives. Their engagement from the patient’s history to recognizing and comprehending their condition will be optimal.\nInvolve caregivers in decision-making wherever possible, respecting their choices and cultural views. Communicate effectively with the child’s caregivers, giving them updates on the child’s status, outlining the planned interventions, and answering any worries or questions they may have.",

    "text": "5.4 Interventions\nChildren who are critically ill require emergent and timely life-sustaining interventions. Resuscitation and supportive care are two interventions that are usually utilized to revive patients and assist vital organs to recover until they can function within the survivable level.\n\n5.4.1 Resuscitation\nThe process of treating a critically ill patient’s physiological abnormalities is known as resuscitation, and it occurs in every hospital department. It involves various methods that call for a broad range of capabilities that have been systematically developed and applied over time.(Arias et al. 2024)\nIt refers to the act of reviving someone from apparent death or unconsciousness because of cardiorespiratory arrest, often involving procedures such as chest compression, ventilation, cardiac massage, and the use of a defibrillator.(Lewis and McConnell 2018)\nClinical presentation of cardiac arrest in children presents differently from adults. Cardiac (shock), respiratory (respiratory tract infection) and gastrointestinal (diarrhoea and vomiting) conditions are the common predisposing risks that get children into cardiorespiratory arrest.(Meghani 2021) Children frequently move to cardiac arrest through respiratory or circulatory failure, the pre-arrest period in children is typically characterized by respiratory distress or failure, shock, or a combination of these factors.\n\n\n5.4.2 Critical organ dysfunction or failure\nManifestation of children’s pre-cardiac arrest stage includes:\n\nRespiratory distress\n\nIncreased work of breathing: Using auxiliary muscles, nasal flaring, grunting, and retractions (intercostal, subcostal, and suprasternal).\nAbnormal breath sounds including crackles, stridor, wheezing, or reduced breath sounds.\nAlterations in breathing pattern: Bradypnea (slow breathing) or tachypnoea (fast breathing).\n\nRespiratory failure\n\nCyanosis: Bluish discolouration of the skin, especially around the lips and fingertips, indicating hypoxemia.\nAltered Mental Status: Lethargy, irritability, or unresponsiveness due to inadequate oxygenation.\nApnoea: Periods of stopped breathing or significant pauses in breathing.\n\nCirculatory impairment/failure (shock)\n\nTachycardia or abnormally rapid heart rate is frequently the result of an early compensatory mechanism.\nHypotension: Low blood pressure in children is a late and concerning sign.\nPoor perfusion: Cold, clammy skin; longer than two seconds for capillary refill; sluggish or non-existent peripheral pulses.\nAltered mental status: Incomprehension, agitation, or a reduction in reactivity.\n\nNeurological dysfunction\n\nAltered Mental State: Diminished level of alertness, agitation, or lethargy.\nSeizures: In children with known seizure disorders, a new or alterations in seizure patterns.\n\nVital Sign Changes\n\nAbnormal Heart Rate: Tachycardia is common, whilst bradycardia is usually a late sign suggesting severe deterioration.\nAbnormal Respiratory Rate: Both tachypnoea and bradypnea are worrying.\nHypotension: in children, it is frequently a late sign of shock.\n\nLaboratory and Monitoring Data:\n\nHypoxemia: arterial saturation as measured by pulse oximetry.\nHypercapnia: Elevated carbon dioxide readings, indicating inadequate ventilation.\nMetabolic Acidosis: Blood gas analysis shows a drop in blood pH and bicarbonate levels, indicating poor tissue perfusion and oxygenation.\n\n\nManagement of pre-cardiac arrest and cardiac arrest involves prevention by identifying patients at risk, monitoring and managing complications, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and in advanced cases supportive care,\n\n\n5.4.3 Early Recognition and Monitoring:\n\nFrequent or continuous monitoring of vital signs, including HR, RR, CRT, and SpO2 with or without BP.\nRepeated assessments of mental status and perfusion indicators.\nFollowing assessment and monitoring, any abnormalities should be responded to with appropriate interventions such as low SpO2 should be given oxygen and respiratory support for respiratory failure.\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Supportive therapy\nAside from resuscitation among patients with cardiac arrest, those in pre-arrest or return of spontaneous circulation post-resuscitation need supportive care.\nRespiratory Support:\n\nProviding oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation (e.g., CPAP or BiPAP), or mechanical ventilation if needed.\nClearing airway obstructions and ensuring proper airway management.\n\nCirculatory Support:\n\nAdministering fluids judiciously to treat hypovolemia.\nUsing vasoactive medications like epinephrine or norepinephrine for shock.\n\nTreating Underlying Causes:\n\n\n5.4.5 Optimisation of oxygen delivery\nPrevention of cardiac arrest or restoration after cardiac arrest of a patient to health requires optimisation of the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and flow of blood to the tissues. These require\n\nProvide oxygen to the lungs so that red blood cells can take it\nSufficient haemoglobin levels to bind oxygen\nImprove cardiac contractility to guarantee enough blood pumping optimum vascular tone for all tissue beds to be perfused\nEffective intravascular volume to provide sufficient blood flow to the heart’s right side.\n\nChildren with critical illness require early identification, institution of timely intervention, assessment and effective monitoring.  Understanding the complex interaction of clinical, infrastructural, workforce, family, and systemic factors affects the outcomes of pediatric critical illness in hospitals. Improving these parameters using focused interventions, distribution of resources, education, and modifications to policies can greatly enhance the standard of care and survival rates for children with critical illness.\n\n\n\n\nAppiah, J A, S Salie, A Argent, and B Morrow. 2018. “Characteristics, Course and Outcomes of Children Admitted to a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit After Cardiac Arrest.” Southern African Journal of Critical Care 34 (2): 58. https://doi.org/10.7196/sajcc.2018.v34i2.355.\n\n\nArias, Anita V, Michael Lintner-Rivera, Nadeem I Shafi, Qalab Abbas, Abdelhafeez H Abdelhafeez, Muhammad Ali, Halaashuor Ammar, et al. 2024. “A Research Definition and Framework for Acute Paediatric Critical Illness Across Resource-Variable Settings: A Modified Delphi Consensus.” The Lancet Global Health 12 (2): e331–40. https://doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(23)00537-5.\n\n\nLewis, Grant, and Paul McConnell. 2018. “Ethical Issues in Resuscitation and Intensive Care.” Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine 19 (12): 644–47. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpaic.2018.09.004.\n\n\nMeghani, Shaista. 2021. “Witnessed Resuscitation: A Concept Analysis.” Intensive and Critical Care Nursing 64 (June): 103003. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2020.103003.\n\n\nSakaan, Firas, Adrian Holloway, Qalab Abbas, John Appiah, Jonah Attebery, Paula Caporal, Ericka Fink, et al. 2022. “643: ESTIMATING THE GLOBAL PREVALENCE OF PEDIATRIC ACUTE CRITICAL ILLNESS IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS.” Critical Care Medicine 51 (1): 311–11. https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000908304.12117.81.",

    "text": "6.3 Shock\n\n6.3.1 Definition\nShock is an acute process characterised by the body’s inability to deliver adequate oxygen to meet the metabolic demands of vital organs and tissues.\n\n\n6.3.2 Pathophysiology\nAmong the key functions of the CVS is the delivery of blood to tissues, and perfusion. Figure 6.1 summarizes the concept of oxygen delivery and adequate blood flow to the tissues with enough oxygen in the blood. This ensures that oxygen and nutrients are sent to the tissues to meet metabolic demands. Blood flow is dependent on stroke volume (mechanical function of the heart) and blood oxygen content of blood. Failure of the CVS to perform this function results in an imbalance in oxygen supply and tissue demand leading to anaerobic metabolism. This alternative energy production pathway to sustain life is associated with unwanted metabolites including lactic acid disturbing the homeostasis environment. When prolonged and not reversed promptly it usually leads to irreversible tissue damage and ultimately, death. Shock is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and a leading cause of emergency and intensive care unit admission. Stroke volume is dependent on the volume of blood at the end-diastole (preload), cardiac muscle integrity (myocardial contractility) and the resistance against which the heart pumps (afterload)  is influenced by Oxygen carried by haemoglobin (Hb X Arterial oxygen saturation, SpO2) + Dissolved oxygen in the blood (0.003 × Arterial partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2). The oxygen delivery to tissues equation is represented by\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Oxygen delivery (DO2) equation\n\n\n\n\nCO = Cardiac output, CaO2 = arterial oxygen content, HR = Heart rate, SV = stroke volume, SpO2 = arterial oxygen saturation, PaO2 = partial pressure of arterial oxygen tension.\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Clinical stages of shock\nIn impaired hemodynamic states, the body is not able to deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. This results in a cascade of biomedical processes initiated by anaerobic metabolism and if not corrected the processes lead to vascular endothelial injury and irreversible damage Figure 2. Shock may be categorized into stages to assist with diagnosis and management\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Stages of shock with characteristics and clinical features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\nPathophysiology\nClinical Features\n\n\n\n\nPre-shock\nThere is impaired hemodynamic status, but the body can fall on its physiological reserve and intrinsic autoregulation to compensate mechanisms to attenuate its untoward undesired effect.\nTachycardia, Tachypnoea, Cool core to periphery temperature\n\n\nShock\nEnsues when the compensatory reserve is exhausted with full-blown clinical manifestation of the cardiovascular system\nAbove plus Capillary refill time &gt; 3 seconds, +/- hypotension\n\n\nEnd-organ dysfunction or failure\nDuring this stage distant organs are affected. Usually, the terminal process results from loss of autoregulation leading to death or permanent organ damage in patients who survive.\nNeurology (altered level of consciousness) Genito-urinary (reduced urine output) Laboratory (evidence of organ dysfunction - liver, renal, coagulation etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Classification\n\nAt the bedside, shock is conveniently classified as either compensated or uncompensated. The former refers to the early stages of shock when the body can mount a response to maintain perfusion. Uncompensated shock refers to the loss of the body’s compensatory response.\nOther classifications based on core-to-peripheral body temperature are cold and warm shock. Clinical presentation may vary depending on the state of the patient and may drift in and out of these classifications. Without intervention and monitoring for stability, there should not be seen an improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A(Shock states with low perfusion)--&gt;B(Inadequate oxygen delivery);\n    B--&gt;C(Anaerobic metabolism);\n    C--&gt;D(Increased Lactate);\n    C--&gt;E(Free radical);\n    C--&gt;F(Immune response);\n    E--&gt;G(Energy dependent ion &lt;br&gt; gated function loss, &lt;br&gt; microcirculation failure );\n    E--&gt;H(Cellular death);\n    F--&gt;H;\n    F--&gt;I(Vascular dysregulation &lt;br&gt; and coagulopathy);\n    G--&gt;J(Fluid leak,vasodilataion, &lt;br&gt; tissue swelling);\n    H--&gt;K(Vital organ damage);\n    I--&gt;L(Disseminated intravascular &lt;br&gt; coagulopathy);\n    G--&gt;H\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Simplified cascade processes resulting from shock hypoxia, free radical formation, and hypoxia lead to inefficient anaerobic metabolism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.5 Types of Shock\nBased on etiology shock may grouped into 5:\n\nHypovolemic shock - the most common cause of shock in paediatrics. There is a reduction in venous return (preload) as a result of internal or external losses. Can be from fluid loss/redistribution, e.g. Vomiting, diarrhoea, burns, third-spacing, blood loss/hemorrhagic shock from trauma, Gastrointestinal bleeds.\nCardiogenic shock- cardiac pump failure secondary to poor myocardial function. E.g. congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopathies- acute myocarditis, and arrhythmias.\nIn obstructive shock any mechanical impediment to adequate cardiac output. Eg. Tension pneumothorax, massive pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade.\nDistributive shock- inadequate vasomotor tone, severe vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability resulting in fluid moving into the interstitium. Examples include f anaphylactic and shock neurogenic shock.\nSeptic shock is usually associated with a combination of distributive, hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock.",

    "text": "6.4 Case discussion\nAccording to the World Health Organization, shock may be clinically diagnosed when there are cold extremities, a capillary refill time of more than 3 seconds, and a fast weak pulse. Hypotension is usually a late sign and not a requirement to diagnose shock promptly. Additional signs attributed to other organs impacted are\n\naltered mental status,\nlow urine output,\nrising liver enzymes, lactic acidosis or base deficit,\nlow mixed and central venous oxygen saturation.\n\nThe 7-month-old baby presents with cold extremities, tachycardia, and slow delayed refill time consistent with shock. It is important to know the aetiology to manage appropriately. Hypovolemia, septic shock, and obstructive may be implicated as the causes of this child’s current condition.\n\nThe history of the illness includes fever cough, poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea.\nFever, poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea suggest possible fluid losses and therefore hypovolemia.\nSimilarly, fever and features suggestive of infection could result from sepsis as a cause of the shock.\nThe cough, respiratory distress requiring oxygen, a hint of respiratory tract infection and possible complications such as pneumothorax.\nLastly, penicillin causes anaphylaxis hence there is a potential anaphylactic.\n\nThe most probable cause of this infant’s shock is septic shock. Given fever, poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea the child may have low intravascular volume.  The suspected infection has progressed to severe disease and the release of cytokines and other immune responses at the tissue and cellular level leading to damaged endothelium and consequently fluid leak from the intracellular space. Inflammatory response and endotoxins may damage vasodilation and myocardium with myocardial dysfunction.\nThe combination of these processes compromises perfusion to the tissues all tissues especially vital organs, the brain, kidney, liver and coagulation. A four-organ system model which included criteria for respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and neurologic dysfunction has been developed to guide the diagnosis of sepsis. Whilst diagnosing sepsis at this point may still not be early enough, the new criteria provide new evidence that should sensitize clinicians to pick patients with infection who are critically ill.\nAcute gastroenteritis is the most common cause of shock in children. Patients rapidly advance to dehydration and shock because of loss of intravascular volume\n\n6.4.1 Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis\nShock is a clinical diagnosis based on history and examination. It is dependent on underlying pathology but there are overlaps in presentation.\n\n\n6.4.2 History\n\nHypovolemic shock- diarrhoea, vomiting, burns, bleeding, jaundice, trauma\nCardiogenic shock- known patient with congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathies, heart failure, easy fatiguability, darkened lips and fingers or toes, palpitations, chest pain, diaphoresis and taking frequent breaks during feeds\nDistributive shock- drug history, allergies, spinal surgery,\nSeptic shock- fever, cough, jaundice, diarrhoea, vomiting, difficulty in breathing, loss of consciousness, seizures,\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Examination\n\nTachycardia\nPoor peripheral perfusion- cold extremities, CRT&gt;3s, weak pulse volume\nRespiratory distress signs- tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, flaring of alae nasae, subcostal recession\nAltered mental status\nHypotension (a late sign)\nOliguria\nSigns of dehydration\n\nOther findings- jaundice, fever, skin lesions, chest signs of pneumonia or pneumothorax, upper airway obstruction murmurs or other heart sounds, signs of raised ICP, oedema, hypo/hyperglycemia, low SpO2 &lt;92%\n\n\n6.4.4 Approach to management\nShock is an emergency! Resuscitation must therefore be timely.\n\n\n6.4.5 Initial assessment\n\nTriage by following assessment and ensuring the airway is patent and maintainable, and breathing is appropriate for age.\nAdminister oxygen\nAdmit the patient to the emergency room.\nSecure intravenous access (preferably the largest vein possible). Intraosseous access is equally useful when IV is difficult to obtain.\nThe first line of most untreated shock is fluid. Recent evidence suggests that large fluid boluses increase mortality.\n\n5-10 ml/kg over 30 minutes, this may be repeated every 30 minutes as needed (non-dehydration related shock). Balanced crystalloids are the fluid of choice (Ringer’s lactate is the crystalloid of preferable), Normal saline may be used in patients with head injuries. Avoid in with or at risk of acute kidney injury.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.6 Second survey\nEvaluate the patient for causes of shock and treat accordingly.\n\nHypovolemic\n\nSevere dehydration because of acute gastroenteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting). Rehydrate using WHO Plan B or C as appropriate\nSevere anaemia – transfuse blood.\nHemorrhage – transfuse blood without blood products as needed\n\nMonitor response to the fluid bolus every 15 – 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n6.4.7 Investigations\nOnce the patient has been resuscitated tailored but detailed investigations are needed.\n\n6.4.7.1 Laboratory\n\nFBC- Anemia, Leukopenia/leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia\nArterial blood gases- acidosis (metabolic/respiratory), low PaO2, high/low PCO2, high lactate, high anion gap\nDeranged liver and renal function test\nAbnormal electrolytes (low Calcium, hyper/hypokalemia)\nAbnormal clotting profile\nSeptic screen - blood, urine, nasopharyngeal swabs, stool, CSF\nChest x-ray indicated suspected lung pathology such as pneumothorax and infections.\nEcho/ECG – useful for diagnosis and monitoring of shock\nNeuroimaging for suspected brain abscess, meningitis and encephalitis.\nMarkers of inflammation/infection- CRP, ESR and procalcitonin. These will be determined by circumstances. It may also be used to guide antibiotic therapy decisions.  \n\n\n\n\n6.4.8 Additional treatment\nFor shock not responding to fluid of 30-40 ml/kg the following may be added.\n\nCardiogenic shock - Inotropes to improve contractility– adrenaline or dobutamine.\nObstructive shock\n\nTension pneumothorax – thoracostomy/chest tube insertion\nmassive pulmonary embolism – anticoagulants\ncardiac tamponade - pericardiocentesis\n\nDistributive shock – adrenaline, phenylephrine\nSeptic shock\n\nFor fluid refractory - noradrenaline, adrenaline, dobutamine\nFor vasopressor and inotrope refractory - steroid stress dose\nAntimicrobial therapy in sepsis within an hour.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.9 Supportive therapy\nIn inotrope-refractory shock, steroids may be given for adrenal insufficiency.\n\nIntensive Care Unit admission as required\nNeuroprotective measures- normothermia, normoglycemia, anti-seizure(if indicated), hyperosmolar therapy\nProviding ventilatory support- invasive vs non-invasive\nWorsening cardiac function requires invasive treatment options like ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) and ventricular-assisted devices. The underlying cause should be looked at after resuscitation and stabilization\nCorrect all electrolyte abnormalities\nNutritional rehabilitation- early initiation of enteral feeds associated with good outcomes\nAnalgesia, antipyretics, anxiolytics. Hemotransfusion if indicated.",

Other risk factors include prematurity, male gender, multiple gestations, being born to a mother with diabetes mellitus and hypothermia. Signs of RDS include tachypnea, grunting, recessions and cyanosis. Prevention involves preventing preterm births and administering corticosteroids to the mother of gestation between 24 to 34 weeks before delivery. Treatment however involves the administration of surfactant.\nNote that this condition is different from Respiratory Distress in a newborn. Respiratory distress is a more generalised term used as a single or a combination of signs as a result of increased work of breathing. It can result from pulmonary as well as non-pulmonary causes.

    "text": "9.5 Metabolic Emergencies\n\n9.5.1 Hypoglycemia\nHypoglycemia is common in the stressed neonate and glucose levels should be monitored regularly. In the newborn period, it is defined as a random blood glucose of &lt; 2.6mmol/l. Risk factors include sepsis, Infant of a diabetic mother, prematurity, Intrauterine growth restriction, birth asphyxia and hypothermia. Signs include Lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, and apnea. Neurological damage may result from hypoglycemia in neonates.\nNeonatal hypoglycemia is most commonly seen in macrosomic infants and infants of diabetic mothers. For these babies, during pregnancy, maternal glucose crosses the placenta to cause fetal hyperglycaemia. The fetal pancreas responds by increasing insulin production. Following delivery, the hyperglycaemic stimulus is instantly removed but insulin production may take longer to slow down. This results in an increased risk and incidence of hypoglycemia at the early newborn period.\nManagement involves initially checking the airway, breathing and circulation. 2ml/kg of IV 10% Dextrose or 5ml/kg of 5% Dextrose may be given PR if IV access is unavailable. Ensure the baby has a normal body temperature (temperature target: 36.50 – 37.50C) as hypothermia prone the baby to hypoglycaemia. Always look for the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia and treat it appropriately.",

    "text": "9.6 Neonatal Sepsis\nSepsis in the neonate kills more than a million babies worldwide every year. It is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs of infection with accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life. It can be categorized into Early Onset Neonatal Sepsis (EOS), which refers to the presence of signs of infection accompanied by a positive culture within the first 72 hours of life, and Late Onset Neonatal Sepsis (LOS), which signifies the onset of signs of infection with a positive culture after 72 hours of life.\nCausative organisms: Early-onset sepsis is typically caused by organisms from the maternal genital tract, whereas late-onset sepsis is caused by organisms in the caregiving environment or community. Common organisms are Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus among others. For many of these organisms, the resistance rate to antibiotics is alarmingly going up.\nAntenal risk factors known to be associated with neonatal jaundice include spontaneous rupture of membranes, less than 37 completed weeks of gestation, spontaneous preterm labour, rupture of membranes greater than 18 hours before delivery, maternal chorioamnionitis, maternal fever of 38 degrees Celsius or more, maternal invasive bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, pre-labour rupture of membranes, Group B Streptococcus infection in a previous baby, or current pregnancy, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and foul-smelling liquor.\nPostnatally, risk factors for neonatal sepsis include prolonged resuscitation at birth, prematurity, invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation, excessive handling, home delivery, lack of hand washing and inadequate Infection prevention control. Others include overcrowding and prolonged hospital stay.\nSigns of neonatal sepsis include\n\nAbnormal colour: Pale, cyanotic, mottled appearance, jaundice, grey\nTemperature instability\nAbdominal signs: distension, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhoea\nRespiratory: Apnea, respiratory distress, gasping (Abnormal breathing)\nHypo - or hyperglycemia\nCardiovascular: Shock, tachycardia (HR &gt; 180), Bradycardia (HR &lt; 80)\nAbnormal bleeding\nCentral Nervous System: Excessive crying, irritability, seizures, altered tone, lethargy,\n\nManagement of neonatal sepsis should be comprehensive. It should include an initial evaluation for resuscitation of the airway, breathing and circulation. Further, the blood sugar should be measured. Early reversal of the shock state by administering an initial bolus of 10ml/kg of crystalloid or its equivalent should be done in the shock present. Vasopressors or inotropes should be used in septic shock only after appropriate volume resuscitation has been done. The goals of the resuscitation should be Normal Cap refill (less than 2 seconds), normal pulses, warm extremities, and appropriate urine output (greater than 1mL/kg/hr).\nIncreased successful treatment of neonatal sepsis requires early recognition and urgent administration of appropriate antibiotics.\nAfter resuscitation, ongoing management usually starts with a detailed history to assess risk factors and other presentations. A thorough physical examination will then be performed, looking for and documenting specific signs indicating severity.\nInvestigations usually include a blood culture. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Ideally, a culture should always be done before the first dose of antibiotics. Other auxiliary investigations include a complete blood count, blood gases, urine culture, and a lumbar puncture. The threshold for performing a lumber puncture in all symptomatic newborns suspected of sepsis should be encouraged. It should however be deferred in neonates considered too unstable to tolerate the procedure, or where there is an absolute contraindication.\nSupportive treatment is essential for a good outcome in neonatal sepsis. Antibiotics are not the entire solution to their treatment. Nutrition or breastfeeding should be optimized. The environment should be thermo-neutral and oxygen saturation should be maintained within the normal range (89 – 95%). Intravenous fluids should be used if the infant is hemodynamically unstable. Monitoring of the blood glucose levels should be instituted. Packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma should be used in the event of anaemia or bleeding.",

Universally accepted as one of the commonest causes of admission and readmission in the first month of life. At Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital Mother Baby Unit, monthly admissions average between 300 and 400 and about 15 to 25% of all these admissions are cases of neonatal jaundice. Whereas the developed world describes kernicterus as a rare condition, unfortunately, the same cannot be said for us in developing countries. On average, cases of severe Neonatal Jaundice have ranged from 2.2% to 30.8% of all jaundice cases, with the monthly mortality ranging from 2.8% to 15.2%(REFERENCE).

    "text": "10.2 Bilirubin metabolism\nHumans continuously form bilirubin and the liver is the main organ responsible for the metabolism of bilirubin. For every gram of haemoglobin, 35mg of bilirubin is produced. The bilirubin is conjugated by the UGT enzyme, making it water-soluble, which is then released into the bile before being excreted in the stool (and urine). It can also be broken down in the intestine by bacterial enzymes like E. coli. However, at birth, the newborn has several challenges. The liver is immature, and the levels of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) enzyme are low. Newborns have β-glucuronidase in the intestinal mucosa/brush border, which deconjugates the conjugated bilirubin found in the meconium. The unconjugated bilirubin can now be reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and recycled back into the circulation. This process is known as the “enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin”. The gut is sterile and, subsequently, infants have far fewer bacteria in the gut, and so very little, if any, bilirubin is reduced to urobilin and stercobilin.\nSpecifically in newborns, more bilirubin is produced, on account of the short life span of Red Blood Cells and high Hemoglobin levels. The liver is immature. They also have fewer bacteria and low intestinal enzymatic activity in the intestine",

    "section": "10.4 Types of Jaundice",
    "text": "10.4 Types of Jaundice\nThere are two main types of jaundice:\n\n\nPhysiological jaundice and\nPathological jaundice.\n\nThere are three main mechanisms for jaundice:\n\n\nIncreased bilirubin production\nDecreased bilirubin clearance and\nIncreased enterohepatic circulation.\n\n\n10.4.1 Physiological jaundice\n\n10.4.1.1 Increased bilirubin production\nin term newborn infants, bilirubin production is 2 to 3 times higher than in adults. This occurs because newborns have more RBCs and fetal RBCs have a shorter life span than those in adults. Unfortunately, the liver being immature, cannot conjugate and excrete all the bilirubin from the breakdown of all the excess RBCs, thereby resulting in spillover of bilirubin into the blood.\n\n\n10.4.1.2 Bilirubin clearance or excretion\nThis is decreased in newborns, mainly due to the low levels of the UGT enzyme in the liver. UGT activity in term infants at day 7 of age is approximately 1% of that of the adult liver and does not reach adult levels until about 14 weeks of age.\n\n\n10.4.1.3 Enterohepatic circulation\nThe presence of the ß-glucuronidase results in an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, further increasing the bilirubin load in the infant. This is a diagnosis of exclusion\n\n\n\n10.4.2 Pathological jaundice\n\n10.4.2.1 Definition\nNeonatal jaundice is said to be pathologic if:\n\nJaundice in the 1st 24 - 48 hours of life.\nRate of SB rise &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (8.5µmol/L) per hour\nJaundice all over the body (including palms & soles)\nPresence of a danger sign\nHistory of previous siblings having had jaundice at birth\nJaundice in a term newborn after 2 weeks of age or in a preterm infant after 3 weeks of age\nDirect (conjugated) bilirubin concentration &gt; 20% of the total\n\nIt can be caused by certain pathologic conditions or exaggeration of the mechanisms responsible for physiologic neonatal jaundice. Identification of what is causing the jaundice is useful in guiding management, including counselling of the parents and what to expect for the next pregnancy. Most common cause is increased bilirubin production due to haemolytic disease processes that include the following:\n\nIsoimmune-mediated haemolysis (e.g., ABO or Rhesus D incompatibility)\nErythrocyte enzymatic defects, e.g. G6PD deficiency\nSepsis, especially Urinary Tract Infection\nPolycythaemia\nBirth Injuries resulting in sequestration of blood within a closed space, e.g. cephalohematoma, subgaleal bleed.\n\n\n\n10.4.2.2 ABO incompatibility\nThis is one of the most common causes of isoimmune hemolytic disease during the neonatal period. Infants with blood group A or B, carried by blood group O mother, will have a positive antibody because of maternal anti-A or anti-B transfer into the fetal circulation.\n\n\n10.4.2.3 Rhesus Incompatibility\nRh incompatibility can occur when an Rh-negative pregnant mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells secondary to feto-maternal haemorrhage during pregnancy/delivery. As a result, the mother’s blood gets exposed to the fetal circulation and sensitization occurs leading to maternal antibody production against the foreign Rh antigen. Once produced, maternal Rh (IgG) antibodies may cross freely from the placenta to the fetal circulation, where they form antigen-antibody complexes with Rh- positive fetal RBCs and eventually are destroyed, resulting in a fetal alloimmune-induced hemolytic anaemia and jaundice. The first pregnancy is usually not affected, but more antibodies are produced with each pregnancy making the jaundice worse with each pregnancy.\n\n\n10.4.2.4 Decreased clearance\nInherited defects in the gene that encodes the UGT liver enzyme (eg, Gilbert Syndrome), decrease bilirubin conjugation (eg Crigglar Najjar). In physiological jaundice, the levels are naturally low, but here, in addition to the low levels the UGT enzyme is either defective, absent or has a reduced function. This reduces hepatic bilirubin metabolism and its clearance thereby increasing the total serum unconjugated bilirubin levels.\n\n\n10.4.2.5 Increased enterohepatic circulation\nThe major causes are\n\n\nBreastfeeding jaundice\nBreast milk jaundice\nImpaired intestinal motility is caused by functional or anatomic obstruction.\nCongenital hypothyroidism also causes increased enterohepatic circulation on account of reduced gut motility.",

The dose in turn is determined by:\n\nThe wavelength of the light\nThe intensity of the light (irradiance)\nThe distance between the light and the baby\nThe body’s surface area is exposed to the light.\n\nEffective phototherapy lowers serum bilirubin levels by converting the lipid-soluble bilirubin into water-soluble forms that can easily be excreted in the stool and urine Phototherapy also prevents the need for an Exchange Blood Transfusion and prevents bilirubin from depositing in the brain. The breakdown of bilirubin begins almost instantaneously when the skin is exposed to light, hence, phototherapy should be started as early as possible.\nIn initiating phototherapy, always note the time the baby’s SBR sample is being taken and estimate the age in hours up until that time. Interpret bilirubin levels according to the baby’s postnatal age in hours and manage the bilirubin levels according to the threshold table Start phototherapy if the SBR plots on or above the line appropriate for age (in hours) and gestational age If the SBR plots just underneath the line, repeat the SBR after 6 hours or start phototherapy if a repeat is not feasible. Repeat the SBR at least 24 to 48 hours after initiation of phototherapy. Discontinue phototherapy when the SBR plots below the line.\nThe side effects of phototherapy include:\n\nIncrease insensible water loss\nLoose stools\nSkin rash\nBronze baby syndrome\nHypo- or Hyperthermia\nInterruption of mother-baby bonding\n\n\n\n10.7.3 Sunlight Therapy\nWorks for physiological jaundice, however, one can never tell by looking at a baby what kind of jaundice a baby has Err on the side of caution, at least always have the SBR checked first Remember prolonged exposure to UV rays can be harmful to the developing skin Baby cannot be put in the light for more than 30 minutes in a day Even most of the available literature and studies that recommend sunlight still advice that if the jaundice is severe, the baby must be managed in the hospital!! A serum bilirubin high enough to warrant treatment should be managed in the hospital.\n\n\n10.7.4 Exchange Blood Transfusion\nProvides a means of rapid reduction of circulating bilirubin in the blood. Involves manual removal of the baby’s blood and simultaneously replacing it with compatible donor blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Exchange Blood Transfusion\n\n\n\nIn addition to reducing bilirubin levels, EBT removes partially hemolyzed RBCs, RBCs coated with antibodies and circulating immunoglobulins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Bilirubin Graph (&gt; 38 weeks)\n\n\n\nComplications of exchange blood transfusion include:\n\nCardiac & respiratory disorders\nShock due to bleeding or inadequate replacement of blood infection\nCatheter-related complications\nChanges in the composition of the blood (high or low potassium, low calcium, low glucose, changes in pH)\nThrombocytopenia\nAnd the rare but serious complications of air embolism, portal hypertension, and necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\n\n\n10.7.5 Intravenous Immunoglobins\nTreatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been suggested as an alternative therapy to Exchange Blood Transfusion for isoimmune hemolytic jaundice to reduce the need for Exchange Blood Transfusion and duration of phototherapy and hospitalization in isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn. It has been proposed that IVIG blocks the binding of the antibody to the antigen. With this blockade, hemolysis no longer occurs.",

Injury from mechanical ventilation and reactive oxygen species to the premature lungs in the presence of antenatal factors predisposing the lung to BPD forms the basis of the pathogenesis in preterm infants. This leads to an inflammatory response with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 IL-8, and TNF alpha, along with growth factors (Transforming growth factors,), angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factors, angiopoietin 2), which result in aberrant tissue repair and arrest in lung development. Dysregulated vascular and arrested alveolar development form the basis of the pathology seen in the new BPD. Histologically, BPD occurs when lung development arrests in the late canaliculi to the saccular stage of lung development. The pathology characteristically demonstrates decreased septation and alveoli hypoplasia resulting in simplified large alveoli and reduced availability for gaseous exchange.",

The arterial supply of the heart is through the coronary arteries while venous drainage is through the coronary sinus. The aorta and pulmonary arteries arise from the left and right ventricles. The heart has three layers:\nVenous blood enters the right atrium through the inferior and superior vena cavae. It empties in atrial systole into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. It then moves on through the pulmonary valve in ventricular systole, to the pulmonary artery and then the lungs. Blood returning from the lungs enters the left atrium through the four pulmonary veins. In atrial systole, it moves into the left ventricle through the mitral valve.

Also, both systolic and diastolic pressures in the aorta are higher than that in the pulmonary artery.\nSystolic pressure in general is generated by the ventricles. In conditions such as coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, the ventricles increase their workload to generate enough pressure.

These are adaptations to using the placenta rather than the lungs for oxygenation. These shunts are the ductus venosus, ductus arteriosus and patent foramen. At birth, these shunts regress. The ductus venosus regresses quickly to form the ligamentum arteriosus. The foramen ovale closes at birth physiologically but may take years to close anatomically. The patent ductus arteriosus closes soon after birth but can physiologically stay open for 72 hours. Beyond this period it is considered to be pathologic if it continues to stay open. Patent ductus arteriosus are quite common in preterm newborns.",

It is further divided into:\n\nAcyanotic: These are congenital heart diseases that are traditionally not known to be associated with cyanosis. Examples include ventricular septal defect (VSD), Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)\nCyanotic: These on the other hand are associated with cyanosis and include Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), Truncus Arteriosus and Tricuspid Atresia.\n\nAcquired heart disorders: These are heart conditions that are not present at birth but develop afterwards. They include Infective Endocarditis (IE), Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and Endomyocardial Fibrosis (EMF)\nRhythm disorders: This set of disorders can present as either congenital or acquired. They affect the electrical system of the heart leading to an increase in heart rate (tachyarrhythmia), decrease in heart rate (bradyarrhythmia) or even normal heart rate.\nSecondary cardiac disorders: Some pathologies tend to affect the heart as a complication. Such conditions include some glycogen storage disorders resulting in cardiomyopathy and Rheumatoid arthritis resulting in pericardial effusion.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "21.1.1 Prenatal\nPrenatally, the history should delve into but not be limited to the following:\n\nInfections: Some infections are the well-known TORCHES. They include Toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, parvovirus B19 (fifth disease), varicella (chickenpox) and (Zika), Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus. Rubella when acquired in the first trimester of pregnancy is very well known to be associated with PDAs.\nMedications: The use of some medications, including herbs predisposes to heart disease in newborns. Anticonvulsant such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are highly teratogenic.(Kalisch-Smith, Ved, and Sparrow 2019)\nRecreational drugs: Excessive smoking, cocaine, and alcohol use in early pregnancy are all associated with teratogenic effects on the heart.\nMaternal illnesses: Maternal medical conditions during pregnancy may be associated with heart diseases in their fetuses. Diabetes mellitus is particularly well known, predisposing to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, d-Transposition of the Great Arteries, etc. Autoimmune conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus may also predispose to rhythm disturbances in the fetus and child, even when the mother is not symptomatic.\nFamily history of CHD: The recurrence of CHD in first-degree relatives varies but is almost always higher than in the rest of the population. For instance, having a first-degree relation with a cornoventricular defect is associated with a recurrence risk ratio of 24.3 (95% CI,12.2 to 48.7), 7.1 (95% CI, 4.5 to 11.1) for isolated Atrial Septal Defect, and 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.3) for isolated Ventricular Septal Defect.(Øyen et al. 2009)\n\n\n\n21.1.2 Perinatal\nPerinatal history associated with heart disease may include the following:\n\nBirth weight: A high birth weight, often associated with a child of a diabetic mother is also associated with an increased incidence of CHDs. Conversely, a low birth weight may also be associated with fetal alcohol syndrome or congenital rubella syndrome, both of which are associated with CHDs.\nNewborn resuscitation: Some critical CHDs can be similar to neonatal asphyxia in a newborn, thus requiring resuscitation.\n\n\n\n21.1.3 After birth\nAscertaining history after birth is the most extensive. Many of these are directed to the features of heart failure. These include:\n\nGrowth failure: Poor weight gain is a very prominent feature of CHDs in children. Many clinically significant CHDs result in poor feeding, chronic metabolic demand on the patient and poor oxygenation in cyanotic CHDs. All these result in increased caloric demand, resulting in poor growth.\nCyanotic spells: Some cyanotic CHDs are associated with recurrent periods where the child has increasing cyanosis, sometimes associated with weakness, fast breathing and even unconsciousness. The presence of these spells may be a pointer to a CHD.\nSquatting and exercise intolerance: Exercise intolerance is a common presentation of heart disease in children. However, for some cyanotic congenital heart diseases, most notably Tetralogy of Fallot, the added feature is frequent squatting when the child becomes fatigued.\nDelayed milestones: Growth failure, easy fatiguability and other genetic syndromes may result in delayed motor milestones in the child.\nOthers: Fast and sometimes difficulty breathing are also common presentations of CHDs. Some children develop oedema.(Figure 21.1) This is predominantly seen in the faces of younger children and the feet of older children. Frequent lower respiratory infection is also seen in children with heart diseases, especially those associated with heart failure.\nUncommon symptoms: Uncommon presentation of heart disease in children include:\n\nChest pain is a rather feared symptom in adults but usually portends another diagnosis rather than heart disease in children.\nSyncope can be observed in children with an arrhythmia, or left or right ventricular obstruction. However, this is still not a common presentation in pediatric heart diseases.\nOlder children report palpitations.\nJoint swelling does occur in Rheumatic Heart Disease but again not a common presentation in children with heart pathology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.1: Pedal oedema in a child with heart failure",

    "text": "21.2 Clinical examination\n\n21.2.1 General\nClinical examination for a child with a suspected heart disease should always start as general. One should first look out for life-threatening signs and intervene quickly. Subsequent steps could include:\n\nNutritional status is very important as many children with chronic heart conditions with significant heart failure present with malnutrition. The growth pattern of the patient should always be evaluated.\nDysmorphism is very critical in pediatric heart diseases. As much as 23% of all children with CHD will have a chromosomal abnormality.(Wang et al. 2023) There are many genetic syndromes with well-documented recognisable heart defects. Below are just a few adapted from Ko (2015):\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.1: Common genetic syndromes associated with congenital heart diseases\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic syndrome\n% with CHD\nCardiac anomalies\n\n\n\n\nDown Syndrome\n40 to 50\nAtrial Septal Defect, Ventricular Septal Defect, Atrioventricular Canal Defect, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n\nTurner’s syndrome\n25 to 45\nCoarctation of the Aorta. Bicuspid Aortic Valve, Aortic Stenosis, Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n\n\nDiGeorge syndrome\n70 to 75\nAortic arch anomalies, Truncus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n\nWilliam’s syndrome\n75 to 80\nSupravalvar Aortic Stenosis, Peripheral Pulmonary Stenosis\n\n\nNoonan syndrome\n70 to 80\nPulmonary Stenosis, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Atrial Septal Defect\n\n\nKabuki syndrome\n31 to 55\nCoarctation of the Aorta, Atrial Septal Defect, Aortic Stenosis, Mitral Stenosis, Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n\n\nAlagille syndrome\n90\nPeripheral Pulmonary Stenosis, Pulmonary Stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour: The skin colour of a child with a CHD could hold signs of its presence. Cyanosis, the blueish duskiness of the skin and mucous membranes can be seen in children with a cyanotic congenital heart disease. In black skin, this may be difficult and can only be observed in the mouth and tongue (Figure 21.2). Mild cyanosis is often not visible and may require the use of pulse oximetry. Pallor can be observed in patients with heart diseases, such as Infective Endocarditis. Jaundice can be observed in patients with Infective Endocarditis or those with hepatic injury secondary to chronic heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.2: Cyanosis in the tongue of a child\n\n\n\n\nClubbing: All four stages of digital clubbing are seen in children with cyanotic CHD or Infective Endocarditis. (Figure 21.3) Note that some cases of finger clubbing may be familial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.3: Finger clubbing\n\n\n\n\nRespiratory signs: Respiratory signs commonly associated with heart diseases in children are tachypnoea, dyspnoea, chest recessions and increased work of breathing. These are especially true when there is associated heart failure and worsens with exercise or breastfeeding infants.\nCirculation: The circulation in a child with a suspected heart disease is critical. Reduced circulation can be assessed with the warmth of the extremities, capillary refill time, and blood pressure.\nBlood pressure: Low blood pressure is a late sign of circulatory failure and cardiogenic shock. Conversely, weak pulse may be associated with hypertensive heart disease as well. Wide pulse pressure, an abnormally wide difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures may indicate a patent ductus arteriosus, aortic insufficiency or an aorticopulmonary window. Blood pressure should be checked in the upper and lower limbs as a higher BP in the upper limbs compared to the lower may indicate the presence of a Coarctation of the Aorta.\nPulses: The radial pulse is the most routinely examined in cardiovascular examination. It should be checked for the rate, rhythm, volume and character. If they are difficult to examine, especially in young infants, the brachial pulsus can be used. Other pulses should be examined and they include the brachial pulses, femoral and dorsalis pedis. Next, synchronization of the radio-femoral pulse should be determined for a delay. This happens in the coarctation of the aorta. Pulses difficult to palpate or inconsistent could be caused by large artery arteritis such as Taksyasu’s arteritis.\n\n\n\n21.2.2 Precordial\n\nInspection: Inspection of the precordium yields a wealth of information in a child with a suspected heart disease. A midline bulge or left-sided bulge will often indicate a right or left-sided heart chamber dilatation. Visible precordial pulsation should be noted. Scars, especially from previous surgeries are useful. Scarification, the usually small “medicinal” scars done on the chest as a means of treatment should also be noted. A Harrison sulcus, depression of the lower part of the chest is common in children with chronic heart failure and thus dyspnoea. Figure 21.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.4: Chest bulge and Harrison’s sulcus in child\n\n\n\n\nPalpation: Palpation should be directed toward determining the presence of a thrill (a palpable murmur), heave at the apex or middle of the precordium. Also, a palpable heart sound, especially the second at the upper left sternal edge may indicate pulmonary hypertension.\nPercussion: This is of very little relevance in the examination of the heart in children.\nAuscultation: Auscultation of the heart can yield a wealth of information. It should be done in a quiet environment, with the child as calm as possible. Auscultating can be performed with both bell and diaphragm. All four auscultatory areas need to be auscultated. It is always prudent to auscultate the back (between the scapulae) and over the carotids. First, the regular two heart sounds should be determined. If muffled, they could indicate a pericardial effusion or sometimes obesity. Pulmonary hypertension and an Atrial Septal Defect for instance could result in a loud or split second heart sound. The presence of a third heart sound (S3) is not always pathologic in children but an S4 is. The presence of a murmur needs to be determined. If present, it should be determined if it is systolic or diastolic, and the point of maximal intensity. It needs to be graded (Table 21.2) and the presence of radiation ascertained. Table 21.3 indicates types of murmurs, their location and likely heart diseases. Diastolic murmurs are difficult to appreciate for the average medical student but may be present in aortic regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation, and at the cardiac apex in cases of heart failure secondary to a large left-to-right shunt. It is of note that approximately 80% of murmurs in children can be categorised as “innocent murmurs” as they are not associated with cardiac pathology.\nOther sounds need to be evaluated as well. These may include a pericardial rub which occurs in pericarditis, an ejection click heart in early systole and cases of aortic or pulmonary stenosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.2: Grades of murmurs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGrade I\nBarely perceptible\n\n\nGrade II\nSoft, but easily audible\n\n\nGrade III\nModerately loud but has not thrill\n\n\nGrade IV\nLoud and associated with a thrill\n\n\nGrade V\nAudible with stethoscope partially of the chest\n\n\nGrade VI\nAudible with stethoscope off the chest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.3: Heart diseases and their murmur characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurmur\nLocation\nCondition\n\n\n\n\nPansystolic\nLLSB\nVSD, Tricuspid regurgitation\n\n\nPansystolic\nApex\nRheumatic Heart Disease, Mitral valve prolapse\n\n\nEjection systolic\nURSB\nAortic stenosis\n\n\nEjection systolic\nULSB\nASD, Pulmonary stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot, Coarctation of the aorta\n\n\nContinuous\n2nd left ICS\nPatent Dutus Arteriosus",

    "text": "21.3 Investigation\nVarious investigations used in the diagnosis and management of heart diseases are:\n\nPulse Oximetry: The usefulness of pulse oximetry is in determining the heart rate and oxygen saturation. An oxygen saturation that is lower than expected (&lt;95% outside the early neonatal period) is considered abnormal, and a strong indication of a cyanotic heart disease in the presence of a non-pathologic lung.\nElectrocardiogram: The electrocardiogram is a common modality for the bedside investigation of heart diseases in all age groups. It gives indications of the heart rate, rhythm, chamber dilatation, wall thickness, laterality of the chambers, electrolyte abnormalities and even the presence of a head injury. It is often not conclusive in many heart conditions but serves as a good auxiliary test in children, especially post-surgery. There are various types: The routine ECG takes just a few minutes to perform on a resting patient usually lying supine. The stress ECG on the other hand is usually done with the heart under stress, as may happen during an aerobic exercise. The Holter ECG on the other hand is attached to the patient and continuously monitors the heart for 24 to 48 hours. This usually gives a better reflection of the electrical activity of the heart over a prolonged period, instead of just a brief period.\nX-ray: A chest x-ray is very useful in diagnosing and managing heart diseases in children. Fortunately, it is readily available in many parts of Ghana. Both posteroanterior and lateral chest X-rays can be useful in assessing the individual chamber and overall heart sizes. Cardiomegaly, assessed with a cardiothoracic ratio &gt; 60% in children is seen in many cases of heart disease. Chest X-rays also indicate ling pathologies, often showing as opacification or silhouetting. Increased lung markings for instance can be found in patients with VSD and ASD while decreased lung markings are often seen in Tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis. The shape of the heart is often an indicator of the underlying cardiac pathology. A Boot-shaped heart may indicate a Tetralofy of Fallot (Figure 21.7) while a globular-shaped heart points to dilated cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Figure 21.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.5: Chest x-ray showing cardiomegaly and lung shadowing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.6: Chest x-ray showing a globular heart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.7: Boot-shaped heart of Chest X-X-ray\n\n\n\n\nEchocardiogram: This is is rather old but new investigatory modality. Old because it has been around since the 1960s, and new because it is relatively new in Ghana. It is however a very useful modality of investigation. An echocardiogram is essentially an ultrasound of the heart and great vessels. Its biggest advantage is its ability to visualise the heart in real-time, assess systolic and diastolic functions, measure chamber sizes and wall thickness, detect defects such as ventricular septal defect, determine valvular abnormalities such as stenosis and regurgitation, and even assess all these under stressful situation (stress echocardiogram). The video below illustrates the various echocardiographic views used in children. Unfortunately, since it is very user dependent it is not commonly available in Ghana with pediatric echocardiography only currently available in Accra, Kumasi, Cape Coast and Tamale.\n\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan and Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI): These are more advanced modalities available for use, especially when an echocardiogram is inconclusive or further study of the patient is necessary. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays taken at different angles to generate the image and does not the complication of significant X-ray radiation exposure. Both modalities can employ the use of contrast to delineate vessels.\nOthers: Other specialised investigatory modalities are used as required. These include cardiac catheterization in a specialised catheter laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\nKalisch-Smith, Jacinta Isabelle, Nikita Ved, and Duncan Burnaby Sparrow. 2019. “Environmental Risk Factors for Congenital Heart Disease.” Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology 12 (3): a037234. https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a037234.\n\n\nKo, Jung Min. 2015. “Genetic Syndromes Associated with Congenital Heart Disease.” Korean Circulation Journal 45 (5): 357. https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2015.45.5.357.\n\n\nØyen, Nina, Gry Poulsen, Heather A.

There are 3 main groups of causes:\n\nVentricular dysfunction: This is where there is a dysfunction of the ventricles. It is usually a systolic dysfunction but may also be diastolic. Examples are:\n\nCardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive and hypertrophic)\nMyocarditis\nArrhythmias\nCoronary artery anomalies\nPost-op cardiac dysfunction\n\nVolume overload: This occurs in conditions associated with increased volume (preload) in the heart especially the ventricles. The ventricle must therefore eject an increased blood volume, leading to tachycardia. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. Examples include:\n\nVentricular septal defect (left to right shunt)\nAtrial septal defect\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nAortic regurgitation (left ventricle)\nMitral regurgitation (Left atrium)\n\nPressure overload: This is when heart failure is caused by an increased pressure (afterload) in the heart. Ventricles must therefore contract against higher pressures. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. These include:\n\nHypertension\nAortic valve stenosis\nPulmonary stenosis\nCoarctation of the aorta\n\n\nIn all these, the result is decreased cardiac output and pulmonary oedema.",

Heart transplantation is the last option in some cases of heart failure.\n\n\n22.7.2 Pharmacological treatment\nTreatment depends on the clinical presentation and cause of the heart failure. There are 2 main groups to be considered:\n\n\n22.7.3 Acute decompensated heart failure\n\n\n\nTable 22.3: Drugs used in acute decompensated heart failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\nAction\n\n\n\n\nDiuretics\nNotable here is furosemide. The aim is to help decongest the lungs, reduce preload by vasodilatation and improve heart failure symptoms.\n\n\nInotropes\nThese include adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine and dobutamine. They help improve the contractility of the heart, increase heart rate, and increase peripheral vascular resistance, thus maintaining the blood pressure and cardiac output. They are usually Intravenous medications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.7.4 Chronic heart failure\nThese are usually oral medications given to treat heart failure on an outpatient basis\n\n\n\nTable 22.4: Drugs for chronic heart failure treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nAction\n\n\n\n\nDiuretics\nThese are given to decongest the lungs, liver and other edematous organs. The most commonly used is furosemide.\n\n\nAldosterone antagonists\nThese counteract the aldosterone effect of water and sodium retention. They decrease afterload while helping in reversing cardiac remodelling.\n\n\nACE-I/ARB\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers counteract the renin effects of increasing afterload. They thus decrease the afterload and help reverse and prevent cardiac remodelling\n\n\nDigoxin\nThis is probably the oldest anti-heart failure medication. It has negative chronotropic and positive inotropic effects. Thus increasing contractility and reducing heart rate.\n\n\n\\(\\beta\\) -adrenergic blocking\nThese are adrenergic-blocking agents that work by decreasing sympathetic activity to the heart, decreasing heart rate, and thus decreasing oxygen demand. Examples are Propranolol, Atenolol and Carvedilol.",

Thus an uncomplicated ASD is acyanotic. The shunting also leads to volume overload of the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery and lungs. This consequently results in dilatation of the right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery, and pulmonary oedema. The low pressure in the atria implies low pressure in the right ventricle, pulmonary artery and lungs. This reduces the extent of pulmonary oedema and subsequently overt heart failure in a child with ASD, compared to other congenital heart defects such as ventricular septal defects. However, longstanding long-standing lesions or relatively large ones, especially those with a pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio of 2 or more could lead to heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension after about 15 to 20 years with subsequent reversal of the shunt.",

    "text": "24.2 Pathophysiology\nTypically VSD without the presence of another congenital heart malformation results in a left to right ventricle shunting lesion because of the pressure difference. Thus, a VSD is usually an acyanotic congenital heart lesion. This leads to a volume overload of the pulmonary artery, lungs, left atrium and left ventricle. These chambers subsequently dilated. Pulmonary edema develops from lung congestion leading to signs of heart failure.\nSecondly, depending on the size of the defect the pressure in the left ventricle will get transmitted to the right. How much pressure is transmitted depends on the size of the defect with bigger defects transmitting more than smaller ones. This can result in increased right ventricular pressure, and hypertrophy. It also worsens the pulmonary oedema already mentioned above.\nPersistent pressure and volume overload cause remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in permanent changes and pulmonary hypertension. When the pulmonary pressure rises significantly higher than the systemic pressure, a reversal of the shunt results, leading to decreased oxygen saturation.",

Larger ones result in relatively higher pressure and volume. Small VSDs are usually asymptomatic with no volume or pressure overload of the lung, pulmonary artery and right heart. Some volume and pressure overload usually accompanies moderate-sized VSDs. They are thus often accompanied by some heart failure and recurrent lower respiratory infections. Large defects are accompanied by severe volume and pressure overload. They present with persistent heart failure and failure to thrive, exercise intolerance. When longstanding, they often end up with significant pulmonary hypertension.\nNewborns with VSD may not have a murmur at birth. This is due to relatively high pulmonary pressure in the first weeks of life. The intensity of the murmur may increase as the pulmonary pressure decreases, usually over 4 weeks. The patient then becomes more symptomatic with a louder pansystolic murmur loudest at the lower left sternal border. Patients with a large defect may present with an apical diastolic rumble. Cyanosis may present in a long-standing large VSD with pulmonary hypertension.",

At birth, the rise in PaO2 and decline in prostaglandin concentration cause closure of the ductus arteriosus, typically beginning within the first 10 to 15 hours of life. If this normal process does not occur, the ductus arteriosus will remain patent. The PDA then results in excess blood shunting from the aorta, across the duct and into the pulmonary artery. This shunting causes volume overload. There is therefore a circuit of excess blood volume in the pulmonary arteries, lungs, left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta. This subsequently leads to dilatation of the left pulmonary artery, left atrium and left ventricle as well as pulmonary edema and heart failure.",

    "text": "27.4 Pathophysiology\n\nThe severity of clinical signs and symptoms depends on the proportion of the cardiac output going through the pulmonary artery, the relative pressures in the right and left ventricles, and the proportion of the aorta overriding the VSD.\nThe VSD is normally of a significant size, which causes the systolic pressures between the ventricles to equalize. In mild ToF, the left ventricular pressures remain higher than the right ventricle, thus blood shunts from left to right through the VSD. These patients are normally acyanotic. In more severe diseases, due to increased right ventricular pressure (secondary to Pulmonary Stenosis), the shunt direction reverses from right to left allowing the mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood. This results in lower oxygenated blood in the systemic circulation; hence patients are cyanotic.\nPulmonary stenosis can be classified according to its location. The commonest site is the infundibular septum (50%). The stenosis may also be valvular (10%) or a combination (30%). This results in impaired flow of deoxygenated blood into the main pulmonary artery. It may be severe enough to cause intermittent right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This forms the basis of hypercyanotic episodes (tet spells).\nHypertrophy of the right ventricle occurs in response to the high pressures it must overcome to force deoxygenated blood through the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Compared to the normal heart, the aorta in ToF is dilated and displaced over the interventricular septum. Aortic dilatation is caused by an increase in blood flow through the aorta as it receives blood from both ventricles via the Ventricular Septal Defect.",

In children who can walk, frequent squatting is observed in unrepaired ToF. Other features include poor feeding and poor weight gain.\nPhysical examination of children with ToF may reveal digital clubbing of varying stages, central cyanosis, and plethora, usually seen in the hands and eyes.

Iron treatment in ToF is therefore key in its outpatient management. Nutritional rehabilitation is done for chronically malnourished patients.\nSurgical therapy is the definitive treatment.

    "text": "27.13 Hypercyanotic spell\nHypercyanotic spell (tet spell) is an emergency in children with ToF and to a lesser extent, other cyanotic congenital heart diseases. It presents most commonly in children less than 2 years.\n\n27.13.1 Presentation\nChildren with hypercyanotic spells present with paroxysms of increased and deep breathing, irritability, prolonged, unsettled crying, increasing cyanosis, seizures, and decreased intensity of heart murmur. In untreated cases, this might lead to brain damage or death.\n\n\n27.13.2 Pathophysiology\nA hypercyanitic spell can have many precipitating factors. These may include fever, anemia, dehydration, prolonged crying, and eating. These precipitants lead to decreased blood flow to the lungs and progressively increase right-to-left shunting. This leads to increasing cyanosis, tachycardia, and reduced systemic vascular resistance. Carbon dioxide accumulation stimulates the central respiratory center leading to increased and deep breathing. All these unfortunately cause further right-to-left shunting thus perpetuating the hypoxia.\n\n\n27.13.3 Treatment\nThe treatment goal is to increase preload and promote pulmonary blood flow.\n\nFirst, the child should be placed in a knee-chest position. This increases systemic vascular resistance, temporarily raises the systemic pressure, and reduces the right to left shunting.\nOxygen can be administered though it is of limited value and should not be forced on the patient if he is combative.\nNext volume expansion with intravenous fluids should be administered. This raises the preload, and increases systemic pressure, thus aiding in reducing the right-to-left shunting.\nIntramuscular or subcutaneous morphine can be administered. This aids in relaxing the infundibular muscle and thus promotes pulmonary blood flow. It also sedates the child, thus making him/her less acidotic. Acidosis perpetuates the hyperchaotic spell\nIntravenous propranolol, esmolol, or metoprolol are administered to reduce the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\nSome alpha-agonists such as Phenylephrine can be given to improve blood pressure in severe cases\nLong-term treatment may include oral propranolol for prophylaxis, iron supplementation, and surgical correction.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith, Clayton A., Courtney McCracken, Amanda S.

Where there is poor response attributed to a focus e.g. abscess formation, source control should be pursued. Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions are critical to preventing the spread of typhoid. Typhoid is spread via the faecal-oral route when bacteria pass into people’s mouths through food, water, hands, or objects contaminated with faecal matter. Solutions such as water treatment or filtration, installation and management of toilets and sanitation systems, and education about proper handwashing and food-handling practices can save lives and protect people from typhoid infection.

The intricate series of protein-protein interactions that ultimately result in virus infection can be divided into several phases, some of which are essential and others that may modulate the efficiency of the process.(Wilen, Tilton, and Doms 2012)\nInfection with HIV starts without symptoms or ill-feeling and is accompanied by slight changes in the immune system. This stage spans up to three months after infection until seroconversion where HIV-specific antibodies can be detected in individuals following recent exposure. The outcome of infection and duration of disease progression with clinical symptoms may vary greatly between individuals, but often it progresses fairly slowly. It takes several years from primary infection to the development of symptoms of advanced HIV diseases and immunosuppression.(Cunningham et al. 2000) Although individuals may look healthy during primary infection, the virus replicates in infected individuals’ lymph nodes and bloodstream. As a result, the immune system may get slowly damaged by the burst of viral load in their bodies.(Moir, Chun, and Fauci 2011)",

These babies should be given antiretroviral prophylaxis namely nevirapine and zidovudine daily starting from birth (within 24 hours) for 3 months. At week 6, infants should be started on cotrimoxazole daily till HIV infection is ruled out at 18 months. At any point in time when a child tests positive for HIV, treatment with cotrimoxazole should be continued for a longer duration till the child’s immune system is fully re-constituted and appropriate for age. The best marker is appropriate CD4 for age. In the absence of CD4 testing, the child should be virologically suppressed with no evidence of clinical disease.@borges-lujan2022\n\n\n33.7.2 Treatment of HIV infection\nCounselling caregivers and children is a must before initiating HAART.

    "text": "33.13 Answers to sample questions\n\nIt is important to know the duration of the other symptoms if they are beyond 3 months. Ask about interventions, facilities visited and what was done for the patient. The top three possibilities are HIV/AIDS, Malignancy and tuberculosis. Malignancy should be ruled out (REFER TO ONCOLOGY LECTURES). Tuberculosis is confirmed in this child. Since HIV is a risk factor for developing TB, it is right to think of HIV in this child. Remember HIV is a family disease. Parents and other siblings MUST also be screened if they exist.\nTo diagnose HIV test, this child must have positive tests on all tests using the “triple algorithm” namely first response, Oraquick, and SD bioline.\nThis child has confirmed Pulmonary TB. PTB is airborne and therefore there is the need to screen close contacts. This will help identify the index case and put in necessary screening tests. Those who have the disease are treated while those exposed without the disease will need TB preventive therapy.\nThis child’s HIV test was positive. He has both pulmonary TB and TB meningitis. Referring to the notes on WHO clinical staging, PTB is stage 3 while TB Meningitis (TBM) is stage 4. This child therefore has clinical stage 4\nRemember that this child has an opportunist infection (TB). To prevent Immune Reconstitutive Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), this child has to start TB treatment before starting HAART, for PTB HAART is started preferably 2 weeks after TB medication. For TBM, HAART should be started 4-6 weeks after initiating TB medications.\nNote: Drug-drug interaction occurs between some ARVs and rifampicin. Dolutegravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and nevirapine should be doubled when administered simultaneously with rifampicin. When TB treatment ends, extend the duration of the double dose of the ARVs for 2 weeks before reducing the dose to the expected age and weight of the children.\nIn deciding on the best HAART, an ARV should each be selected from groups 1,2 and 3. From group 1, the only feasible option is abacavir because HB is &lt; 8g/dl and weight is &lt; 30 kg(AZT and TCF cannot be used). Under group 2, either 3TC or FTC are possible but 3TC is readily available. Under group 3, DTG will be the best option because EFV has a lower resistance barrier and high community resistance. LPV/r is plausible but twice daily regimen makes compliance more difficult. The best option will be ABC/3TC/DTG (option b is the best choice)\nBeing a drug addict, he may be using intravenous injection which increases his risk of being infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Again, he may be having sexual partners exposing him to STI. He, therefore, has to be investigated for hepatitis B/C, full blood count, and screened for other STIs. The choice of HAART will have to factor in hepatitis B status. TDF can be given because he weighs more than 30 kg and renal function is normal. Based on the previous explanation, TDF/3TC/DTG is the best choice. This option comes as a Fixed dose combination so he will take just 1 tablet daily, improving compliance among adolescents. Should the adolescent be Hepatitis B positive, TDF/3TC are also active against hepatitis B. Adolescents should be referred for appropriate services if there are other co-morbidities. Referral to a clinical psychologist will also be needed because he is addicted to drugs\nAntibodies are IgG and cross the placental to the baby. Newborns testing positive using antibody tests might be maternally transmitted. Antibody tests do not confirm HIV in children below 18 months. These antibodies are expected to disappear by 18 months. The recommended test for a 6-month-old baby is a DNA PCR test (refer to above). Other tests and timelines if the baby is negative at 6 months, are at 9 months (DNA PCR) and 18 months (antibody test)\nFor a 2-month-old, an Hb of 12 is low; therefore, AZT will not be a good option. The HAART of choice is ABC/3TC/DTG",

Many people have TB but are well. A positive tuberculin skin test (TST) suggests infection but a negative TST does not exclude the possibility of infection.\nTB disease occurs in someone with TB infection when the bacteria inside the body start to multiply and become numerous enough to damage one or more organs of the body. This damage causes clinical symptoms and signs. This is referred to as “tuberculosis” or active disease.\nClose contact is defined as living in the same household as, or in frequent contact with (e.g. caregiver, school staff), a source case with PTB.\nMultidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is caused by M. tuberculosis strains that are resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin.\nPre-extensively drug-resistant TB (Pre-XDR): TB caused by M. tuberculosis strains that fulfil the definition of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinolone.\nExtensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB): TB caused by M. tuberculosis strains that fulfil the definition of MDR/RR-TB and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one additional Group A medicine.

Further, immune cells are recruited to wall off the infected macrophages, forming granuloma, the hallmark of TB. Healthy individuals remain latently infected, and the infection is kept at bay at this stage, but it is prone to the risk of reactivation. As the granuloma develops, the bacilli emerge from the macrophages. When the reactivation occurs, M. tb proliferates, the bacterial load becomes overwhelmingly high, and the granuloma ruptures, disseminating the bacteria to the airways. The bacilli are then expectorated as contagious aerosol droplets, restarting the cycle, and infecting other individuals.(Alsayed and Gunosewoyo 2023)",

Taking the history from children and caregivers must include questions on risk factors.\nFor an infection to occur, there are certain factors:\n\nContact with source case (Close contact and duration of contact)\nSource case (Smear positivity: smear positive is more infectious; Cavitation on Chest X-ray: more infectious)\nIncreased exposure (Living in high TB endemic areas; children of families living with HIV)\n\nFactors affecting TB disease:\n\nYoung age ( 2 years and below)\nHIV infection\nOther immunosuppression (Malnutrition, Post-measles)\nNot BCG vaccinated (Risk of disseminated TB or severe TB disease)\n\nPulmonary Tuberculosis\nHistory –The major considerations\nMake every effort to look for the close contact or the household contact who is the source of the infection. It is helpful to note that close contact may be at school in a classroom, dormitory/ school bus, or church. Sometimes, it may be someone who frequently visits the child’s home or a caregiver. In childhood, it may take between 3 months to 2 years from the time of exposure to develop TB disease.\nHistory of symptoms suggestive of TB\nMore commonly children with TB will present with the following symptoms:\n\nCough of any duration or progressive non-remitting cough which may be dry or wet.\nFever (persistent or unexplained)\nLethargy/reduced playfulness/less active\nPoor weight gain or weight loss or very low weight (failure to thrive), flattened growth curve is a very sensitive marker of disease. More specifically it is important to plot the measurement and compare it to previous charts on the growth charts in the child health record booklet\nNight sweat. Since most children sweat at night, it is usually difficult to establish this symptom.\n\nPhysical Examination (Some clinical findings suggestive of PTB)\nGeneral Examination\n\nFever- Temperature that remains persistently high or irregular &gt;37.5 (fever)\nWeight- (confirm poor weight gain, recent weight loss): the weight should be plotted on the child’s growth curve, and any child who “falls off” or is unable to maintain their usual line of growth should be considered as having possible TB\nLength/Height is needed to determine the weight-for-length/height Z-scores (&lt;-3 Z indicates severe wasting)\nMUAC -Middle upper arm circumference of &lt; 12.5 cm\nRespiratory rate - (fast breathing) depends on the patient’s age. (Children 0-2 months above 60cpm, 3 months to 12 months more than 50 CPM and 1-5 years more than 40 CPM)\nSigns of respiratory distress are not specific to TB but must raise the index of suspicion e.g Low oxygen saturation, stridor, and wheezes\n\nPhysical signs suggestive of Extra Pulmonary TB (EPTB) include:\n\nEnlarged cervical lymph nodes which are not painful with or without fistula formation – TB lymphadenopathy;\nPresence of spinal kyphosis (angular swelling) – spinal TB (“gibbous”);\nSigns of non-acute meningitis with poor response to antibiotic treatment and/or with raised intracranial pressure – TB Meningitis;\nPleural effusion, especially one-sided dullness with pleuritic pain in a child who is not acutely ill – pleural TB;\nPericardial effusion, distant or muffled heart sounds or signs of new-onset heart failure – pericardial TB;\nNon-acute distended abdomen with or without ascites – abdominal TB;\nNon-tender swollen joints with painful or abnormal gait – osteoarticular TB.",

Investigations commonly used are grouped into the following categories.\n\nBacteriological investigations\nRadiologic investigations and\nImmunologic investigations.\n\n\n35.6.1 Bacteriological investigations\nXpert MTB/RIF Assay is the recommended first-line investigation for diagnosing TB in children. Results are rapid and determine if the patient has a drug-sensitive or resistant organism. Various specimens may be collected, including expectorated sputum, induced sputum, gastric aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, pleural aspirate urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid tissue and, more recently, stool. Other modalities for confirming TB are smear microscopy and TB cultures.\n\n\n35.6.2 Radiologic investigations\nChildren often have paucibacillary TB and therefore bacteriological yields are low. Various imaging modalities can be suggestive of TB. Chest X-ray is the most frequently used radiological imaging. The presence of hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 35.1), effusions, and cavitations could all support the diagnosis of TB in children. Ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI all have roles in suspected extrapulmonary TB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 35.1: Chest X-ray showing perihilar lymphadenopathy suggestive of TB\n\n\n\n\n\n35.6.3 Immunologic investigations\nImmunological tests provide evidence for TB infection but not TB disease.

The Paediatric TB Medicines comprises of 3 different formulations as follows:\n\nRifampicin + Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide (RHZ) 75/50/150 mg\nEthambutol (E) 100 mg 3. Rifampicin + Isoniazid (RH) 75/50 mg\n\nEvery child receives 2RHZE ( 2 months intensive phase)/4RH (4 months continuation phase) for all forms of TB except TB meningitis and osteoarticular TB where the continuation phase is extended for 10 months (10 RH). For non-severe TB (refer to further reading) 2RHZE/2RH regimen can be applied.\nNote:\nCorticosteroids are often used as an adjunct in the treatment of these forms of TB to prevent complications. These include TB Meningitis; TB Pericarditis; and Pott disease/ TB Spondylitis. Pleural diseases, and Endobronchial TB\nPyridoxine (Vitamin B6) supplement is necessary in some patients to prevent peripheral neuropathy but recommended in ALL HIV-infected persons and severely acute malnourished patients on isoniazid\n\n\n35.7.2 Major side effects\nPotential side effects of TB medications are:\n\nRifampicin: Orange-colored urine, saliva or tears, jaundice\nPyrazinamide: GI disturbances, hepatotoxicity\nEthambutol: GI disturbances, blurred vision\nIsoniazid: numbness and tingling in the extremities, GI disturbances, rash\n\n\n\n35.7.3 TB Preventive Therapy\nEvery person living with HIV should be given TB preventive therapy (TPT) after screening and ruling out active TB disease. Other categories of children requiring TPT after ruling out TB disease are:\n\nNewborns of mothers with TB,\nAll Children exposed to an index case with sputum-positive TB,\nLong-term steroids, and immunocompromised children.\n\nIf a patient develops TB disease, the patient should be investigated, and treatment changed from TPT to full treatment. There are four(4) options for TPT in children:\n\nRifapentine + Isoniazid- weekly for 3 months\nRifampicin + isoniazid – daily for 3 months\nRifampicin- daily for 4 months\nIsoniazid only – daily for 6 months",

She bought cough syrup and amoxicillin at a dispensary. Her coughing got severe and she noted weight loss. At week 39, she visited the hospital and was diagnosed with TB (GeneXpert MTB positive and RIF sensitive). She was started on treatment immediately. She lives in a single room with her 3 other children who are 2 years, 8 years, and 10 years respectively who were all clinically well except the 2 years old who weighed 8 kgs.\n\nIdentify risks of infection for the children\nIdentify risks of disease in children\nHow would you approach the management of the children\n\n\nAnswers\n\nThe risks of infection in the above scenario are sputum-positive MTB on GeneXpert tests and the single room is occupied by a single mother and her children.\nThe risk of TB disease will be in the newborn and the 2-year-old sibling who is already failing to thrive. If the mother has HIV or the children are not immunised with BCG, that would also be a risk factors for disease.\nAll the children have been exposed to TB through a close contact, who happens to be their mother. The mother has to be tested for HIV. If she is positive, all the children should also be tested. All the children would have to be screened for TB. The newborn should ideally not be given BCG vaccine but put on TPT if TB disease is excluded. The recommended TPT will depend on the HIV status of the newborn, but Isoniazid is an option for 6 months. After 6 months of INH, if there is no evidence that the newborn has been exposed to TB (Mantoux testing), the child can be given BCG vaccine. If the newborn has the disease, then full TB treatment should be given. The 2-year-old weighs 8 kg which is evidence of weight faltering. Plot the weight for age on the Z-score. Do other investigations such as Chest X-ray, stool for Xpert, and HIV testing. If the clinical, bacteriological, and imaging are suggestive of TB, treat the 2-year-old. If HIV is positive, remember to adjust the dose of ARVs that interact with rifampicin during TB treatment. If the screening of the 8 and 10 years is normal, then put them on TPT, otherwise treat them\n\nSelf-assessment questions\n\nA 5-year-old boy diagnosed with TB and started on RHZE complained to his mother that he finds it difficult to see clearly what his school teacher has projected in class. Which of the following medications is likely responsible?\n\nIsoniazid\nPyrazinamide\nEthambutol\nRifampicin\n\nExplain why bacteriological yield from children with suspected PTB is often very low.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlsayed, Shahinda S.

This method is used by physiologists and Intensivists. The principle is employed in the measurements of central venous pressure and intracranial pressure in clinical practice.\nThe auscultatory method is done with the use of a sphygmomanometer (either mercury or aneroid) and a stethoscope. This is the gold standard in clinical practice. Korotkoff sounds 1 and 5 sounds are measured for systolic and diastolic bleed pressures respectively. Values obtained are generally lower than direct & oscillometric measurements.\nThe palpation method (flush technique) is performed with the use of a sphygmomanometer and palpating finger. Largely unreliable. Only systolic blood pressure can be measured with this technique. The palpated pulse is generally lower than Korotkoff sound 1 by 10mmHg.\nThe oscillometric method uses a sphygmomanometer and a monitor e.g. digital blood pressure devices and Dynamap. Here, pulsatile blood flow through arterial wall oscillations is transmitted to the cuff encircling the extremity. Korotkoff sound 1 is recorded at the point of rapid increase in oscillation amplitude. Korotkoff sound 5 is recorded as the point of a sudden decrease in oscillation amplitude. Values obtained by oscillometric measurements are generally higher than auscultatory.\nDoppler ultrasound technique: Here a Doppler ultrasound is held over the pulse to magnify the sound so that it is audible without a stethoscope. The sound detected may be 5mmHg higher than Korotkoff sound 1.\nAmbulatory blood pressure measurements. Here, multiple measurements are recorded over time (e.g. 24 hours) with digital devices attached to the limb whilst the patient engages in normal activities outside the hospital. Results are analysed on a computer or paper tracer built into the device using the mean of the readings. It provides a truer picture of blood pressure trends useful in diagnosing “white coat hypertension” and nocturnal hypertension (absence of a normal physiological drop in blood pressure during sleep).",

However, the number of children with essential Hypertension is on the rise, particularly among obese adolescents and those with a positive family history.\nBroadly, aetiology can be categorized into:\n\nRenal disease\nVascular disorders\nEndocrine causes\nNeurologic causes\nRenal tumours\nCatecholamine-secreting tumours\nDrug-induced\nMiscellaneous causes\n\nHowever, since these are often age-specific categorizations are done by age as below:\n\n45.9.1 Neonate to one-year\nCongenital\n\nCongenital lesions of the vasculature\n\nRenal Artery Stenosis\nAortic coarctation\n\nCongenital lesions of renal parenchyma\n\nPolycystic Kidney disease\nDysplastic kidneys\nObstructive uropathy\n\nCongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\n\n11-β hydroxylase deficiency\n17-αhydroxylase def\n\n\nAcquired\n\nRenal artery or vein thrombosis secondary to umbilical artery or vein catheterisation\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia\nMedications\n\nTheophylline/caffeine\nPhenylephrine and Ephedrine Nasal Drops in cold medications\nSteroids\nVitamin D intoxication\n\nTotal Parental Nutrition (high Ca2+)\nMaternal drug use: Cocaine, heroin\n\n\n\n45.9.2 One- to five years\n\nRenal Artery Stenosis\nGlomerulonephritis\nRenal vein thrombosis\nWilms tumour\nNeuroblastoma\nPhaeochromocytoma\nCystic kidney disease\nMonogenic Hypertension (e.g. Liddle’s syndrome)\n\n\n\n45.9.3 Five- to ten-years\n\nGlomerulonephritis\nRenal scars from reflux nephropathies or Urinary Tract Infections\nRenal Artery Stenosis\nCystic renal disease\nEndocrine tumours\nEssential Hypertension\nObesity\n\n\n\n45.9.4 Ten- to twenty-years\n\nObesity\nEssential hypertension\nReflux nephropathies with repeated Urinary Tract Infections\nGlomerulonephritis\nRenal Artery Stenosis\nEndocrine tumours\nHyperthyroidism\nDrugs (Oral Contraceptive Pill, illicit drugs)",

Elevated uric acid levels in hypertensive individuals are associated with adverse outcomes like stroke. Allopurinol treatment is advocated for such individuals.",

Other manifestations are:\n\nFacial palsy\nVisual changes→blindness\nComa\n\nPathophysiology: Disruption of the normal autoregulatory mechanisms of cerebral blood flow. The inability of cerebral vasculature to constrict appropriately in response to the abrupt increase in cerebral blood flow leads to cerebral hyperperfusion. Generally, short-acting antihypertensives are preferred in the initial instance of treatment so that any potentially harmful drop in blood pressure (which could lead to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome {PRES}) could be reversed. Subsequently, long-acting agents could be used Sublingual nifedipine could cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure so it is best avoided or should be used with extreme caution\nTreatment outline:\n\nUse anti-hypertensive drugs\nBlood pressure should be brought down slowly to a desirable level (?stage I) by 48hrs (though not to normal levels) as follows:\n\n1/3 of total blood pressure reduction in 1st 12-hrs\nNext one-third of the subsequent 12-hrs\nFinal one-third over 24-hrs\n\nAlternatively, by a quarter within 6 hours, and the rest in the next 24-36hrs\n\nCommonly preferred drugs include Labetalol infusion, Na nitroprusside infusion, and IV hydralazine infusion. After achieving the desired blood pressure target, oral antihypertensives are then started",

Mother complains his 2-year-old sister has also developed similar lesions 2 days ago.\n\nWhat is your most likely diagnosis?\nHow will you manage this family?\n\n\n68.2.1 Definition & incidence/prevalence\nImpetigo is a common, contagious superficial skin infection. It is seen in all age groups, most common in infants and children. It can involve any body surface but occurs most often on the exposed parts of the body, especially the face, hands, neck and extremities.\n\n\n68.2.2 Aetiology\nIt is caused by streptococci, staphylococci or both.\n\n\n68.2.3 Pathogenesis\nThere are two classic forms\n\nNon-bullous impetigo – accounts for &gt;70% of cases. It is caused by S. aureus or S. pyogenes. Spread by direct contact or through fomites. It begins with a 1 to 2mm erythematous papule or pustule that soon develops into a thin-roofed vesicle or bulla surrounded by a narrow rim of erythema. The vesicle ruptures easily with the release of a thin, cloudy, yellow fluid that dries, forming a honey-coloured crust, the hallmark of non-bullous impetigo. S. pyogenes may cause post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis if the nephrogenic strain is involved. This is shown in Figure 68.1\nBullous impetigo - This is always caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Presents as flaccid, thin-walled bullae or more commonly, tender, shallow erosions surrounded by a remnant of the blister roof. High reservoir sites include nasal carriage of asymptomatic persons and perineum. This is shown in Figure 68.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 68.1: Non-Bullous Impetigo in a Child\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 68.2: Bullous Impetigo in a child\n\n\n\n\n\n68.2.4 Investigations\nDiagnosis is usually made clinically, however, aspirate of the fluid from the lesion can be sent for culture and sensitivity pattern in extensive cases.\n\n\n68.2.5 Treatment\n\nLocal skin care: cleansing, removal of crust\nMild and localised disease- topical antibiotics e.g. Mupirocin\nIn severe or more widespread diseases – oral antibiotics, e.g.: amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, erythromycin\n\nNote: Staph eradication can be considered in people with recurrent impetigo.",

In familial cases, the mother is usually the transmitting parent because a considerable proportion of affected males have problems with fertility. Several mutations in the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have been implicated. Such mutations are currently detected in approximately 70% of cases. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12q24.1 are by far the commonest. There is a correlation between specific gene mutations and the clinical manifestations of the syndrome. Autosomal recessive forms of the disorder have also been identified.",

Suggestive findings on prenatal ultrasound scans include lymphatic system anomalies such as increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma and fetal ascites. Other supportive findings include polyhydramnios, short femur length, renal and cardiac defects (particularly pulmonary valve dysplasia) in the fetus. At birth, most affected neonates appear unremarkable. Birth weight and head circumference are usually within the normal range. A cardiac murmur may be detected on routine newborn examination. Male neonates may have cryptorchidism. The affected infant may present with feeding difficulties requiring ongoing nasogastric feeding or gastrostomy, which can impair growth. Talipes equinovarus may be present in 5% of patients. The characteristic facial features of NS become more apparent in early childhood and include a triangular-shaped face, hypertelorism, blue-green irises, down-slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, ptosis, low-set ears with thickened posteriorly rotated auricles, high nasal bridge and upturned nose, short webbed neck and micrognathia. Short stature is present in 85% of cases. Cutaneous features in childhood include lymphedema affecting the lower limbs and genitals, follicular keratosis of the face and extensor surfaces, multiple lentigines and café au lait spots. Musculoskeletal features include a shield chest, cubitus valgus, pectus carinatum or excavatum, scoliosis, and joint laxity. Affected children are usually hypotonic with delayed motor and speech development. Expressive language skills are more affected. A careful family history is important with emphasis on the presence of congenital heart disease, short stature or unusual facies among first-degree relatives.",

The diagnosis is based on findings in three fundamental areas: characteristic facial dysmorphology, growth retardation and CNS involvement. In addition to these three primary features, prenatal alcohol exposure impairs cardiogenesis and subsequently results in congenital heart disease occurring in about 40 to 54% of children diagnosed with FAS. The estimated global prevalence of FASD among the general population is 7.7 cases per 1,000 individuals.

Although its effect can affect every stage of pregnancy, the risk of facial anomalies and major structural anomalies occurs with exposure during the first trimester, with irreversible damage. The possible teratogenic effects depend on the timing, frequency, duration, amount of alcohol exposure as well as genetic susceptibility. Ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde can alter fetal development by disrupting cellular differentiation and growth, disrupting DNA and protein synthesis and inhibiting cell migration resulting in the various anomalies that can occur. The pathogenesis of congenital heart disease in FAS is not well known but it is hypothesised that fetal alcohol exposure has deleterious effects on the composition of the cardiac extracellular matrix or cardiac fibroblasts based on studies performed in animals (mice).\nAdditionally, prenatal alcohol exposure has been shown to impair cardiac development through numerous cellular mechanisms, including reduction of retinoic acid levels, apoptosis of neural crest cells, suppression of histone acetylation, and altered gene expression. Animal studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure can induce a range of abnormalities in heart structure and function, including thinning of the ventricular walls, decreased ejection fraction (EF), reduced heart weight, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Overt congenital heart defect phenotypes such as ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular canal malformation, cardiac chamber malformations, great vessel defects, and double outlet right ventricle have also been identified in animals.",

Females tend to have milder expression. Features may be classified into physical and cognitive aspects.\n\n92.3.1 Full mutation\n\nPhysical\n\nFacial features: Elongated face, high arched palate, large, cupped ears\nConnective tissue anomalies: Mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilatation, scoliosis, flat feet, and hyperflexible joints.\nOther features: Hypotonia (infancy), macroorchidism (commonly post-pubertal), seizures, recurrent otitis media, strabismus, and refraction errors.\n\nCognitive features\n\nIntellectual disability and developmental delay\nAutism 20-0%\nADHD 80%\nAnxiety (70-100%)\n\n\n\n\n92.3.2 Permutation:\nAffected females have been noted to develop premature ovarian failure, Fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) occurs in later life along with other neurocognitive defects.",

A combination of PCR (measures CGG repeats) and Southern blot of genomic DNA (determines methylation status) yields a sensitivity of 99%. Other investigations may be required for certain features of the disease e.g. an Echocardiogram for mitral valve prolapse.",

These include.\n\nCounselling (including genetic counselling) and testing of family members.\nPsychopharmacology\n\nADHD – stimulants eg. Methylphenidate\nAnxiety and compulsive behaviours – antidepressants eg. SSRIs\nMood instability, aggression – antipsychotics eg. Risperidone\nSeizure control eg. Carbamazepine, valproate. Phenytoin and phenobarbitone are not recommended.\n\nSpeech and language therapy.\nMotor therapy\nIndividualized educational plans\nHealth surveillance\nBehaviour interventions tailored to maximise functioning.
