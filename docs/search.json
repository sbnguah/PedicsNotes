    "text": "12.1 Anatomy, physiology and Pathology\nThe heart is located in the mediastinum of the chest, bounded anteriorly by the sternum, posteriorly by the spine and laterally by the lungs. Externally, the right ventricle is anterior. Most of the left ventricle, left atrium and right atrium are posterior. internally the right and left atria are separated by the tricuspid and mitral valves respectively. The arterial supply of the heart is through the coronary arteries while venous drainage is through the coronary sinus. The aorta and pulmonary arteries arise from the left and right ventricles. The heart has three layers:\n\nEndocardium: Inner epithelial layer of the heart\nMyocardium: Muscular part of the heart\nPericardium: Outer layers of the heart. Divided into the visceral and parietal pericardium.\n\nVenous blood enters the right atrium through the inferior and superior vena cavae. It empties in atrial systole into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. It then moves on through the pulmonary valve in ventricular systole, to the pulmonary artery and the the lungs. Blood returning from the lungs enters the right atrium through the four pulmonary veins. In atrial systole, it moves onto the left ventricle through the mitral valve. Finally, it empties into the aorta through the aortic valve.\nThe heart has an inherent electrical system that automatically depolarises it. The parts are:\n\nThe SinoAtrial (SA) node: This is the pacemaker of the heart and depolarises the two atria.\nAtrioVentricular (AV) node: Receives impulses from the SA node, delays a bit before propagating it further\nHis-purkinje fibre system. Responsible for the spread of electrical impulses to the ventricles\n\nHeart as a pump\nThere is a difference in the pumping action of the heart in utero and after birth.\n\nFetal\n\nMost work is done by the Right ventricle\nThe right Ventricle is therefore relatively hypertrophic\nOnly 15% of the cardiac output is pumped into the lungs\n\nAfter birth\n\nGradual transition to Left ventricle dominance\nGradual fall in pulmonary pressure (over 6 weeks)\nThe left ventricle does most of the work and becomes thicker than the right\n\n\nSystolic and diastolic functions\nSystole: This is the contractile phase of the heart. It starts with the atrium so it empties into the ventricles before the ventricle’s subsequent contract.\nDiastole: This is the relaxation phase where the heart relaxes and lets in blood. It also starts with the atrium and then the ventricles.\nCompliance: This describes how easily the heart chamber relaxes in response to the inflow of blood.\nCardiac Pressures\nThe pressures in the heart vary for different ages and individuals. Generally, the pressure in the atria are lower than that in the ventricles. Also, the pea systolic pressure in the left ventricle is higher than in the right. The diastolic pressure in the left ventricle is however lower than the right ventricle. In the typical adult heart, the following pressures are often observed. Also, both systolic and diastolic pressure in the aorta is higher than that in the pulmonary artery.\nSystolic pressure in general is generated by the ventricles. In conditions such as coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, the ventricles end up increasing their workload to generate enough pressure. The diastolic pressure on the other hand is maintained by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Thus incompetent pulmonary or aortic valve leads to a decrease in diastolic pressure in the the tow vessels respectively."

    "section": "32.2 Ways of measuring blood pressure",
    "text": "32.2 Ways of measuring blood pressure\n\nDirect intra-arterial measurements by placing a catheter into the vessel and measuring the pressure “in line” with the vessel (end-on-pressure). This method is used by physiologists and Intensivists. The principle is employed in the measurements of central venous pressure and intracranial pressure in clinical practice.\nThe auscultatory method is done with the use of a sphygmomanometer (either mercury or aneroid) and a stethoscope. This is the gold standard in clinical practice. Korotkoff sounds 1 and 5 sounds are measured for systolic and diastolic bleed pressures respectively. Values obtained are generally lower than direct & oscillometric measurements.\nThe palpation method (flush technique) is performed with the use of a sphygmomanometer and palpating finger. Largely unreliable. Only systolic blood pressure can be measured with this technique. The palpated pulse is generally lower than Korotkoff sound 1 by 10mmHg.\nThe oscillometric method uses a sphygmomanometer and a monitor e.g. digital blood pressure devices and Dynamap. Here, pulsatile blood flow through arterial wall oscillations is transmitted to the cuff encircling the extremity. Korotkoff sound 1 is recorded at the point of rapid increase in oscillation amplitude. Korotkoff sound 5 is recorded as the point of a sudden decrease in oscillation amplitude. Values obtained by oscillometric measurements are generally higher than auscultatory.\nDoppler ultrasound technique: Here a Doppler ultrasound is held over the pulse to magnify the sound so that it is audible without a stethoscope. The sound detected may be 5mmHg higher than Korotkoff sound 1.\nAmbulatory blood pressure measurements. Here, multiple measurements are recorded over time (e.g. 24 hours) with digital devices attached to the limb whilst the patient engages in normal activities outside the hospital. Results are analysed on a computer or paper tracer built into the device using the mean of the readings. It provides a truer picture of blood pressure trends useful in diagnosing “white coat hypertension” and nocturnal hypertension (absence of a normal physiological drop in blood pressure during sleep)."
