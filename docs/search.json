    "text": "Preface\nMedical knowledge has evolved tremendously over the past century. With the advent of the internet, sharing medical knowledge has become very easy. However, most medical literature available originates from developed countries, thus devoid of the relevant local content for many underdeveloped regions. This is critical for medical education and practice in that these texts often do not consider the cultural relevance of these pathologies, disease patterns and risks, local treatment options and idiosyncrasies of the medical delivery systems. Undoubtedly, these have significant effects on medical education and practice.\nThis text was birthed out of the need to bridge this gap. Though the content is primarily directed at undergraduate medical teaching, it can be beneficial to postgraduate trainees as well.",

The nutritional status of any child should be determined at the end of each pediatric case clerked.\nDifferential diagnosis: In most patient clerking situations, more than one plausible investigation may be considered after a history and physical examination. In such situations, all the plausible diagnoses are differential diagnoses of each other.\nDifferent, distinctive diagnoses: In some situations, the patient may present with more than one unrelated disease. For example, a patient who presents with pneumonia may also have septic arthritis. Such different and distinct diagnoses are not differentials of each other\nHistory\nHistory-taking is pivotal in all medical encounters, whether in emergencies or in “stable” encounters or consultations.\nPaediatric History is essentially the same as adult history, albeit with five additional segments:\n\nInformant\nPregnancy, Birth & Neonatal History     \nImmunization History  \nDietary History  \nDevelopmental History",

    "section": "1.3 The 15 Elements of Pediatrics History",
    "text": "1.3 The 15 Elements of Pediatrics History\nA full history must consist of the following 15 elements:\n\nThe Informant\nDemographics\nPresenting Complaint\nHistory of Presenting Complaint (HPC)\nDirect Question\nSystemic Enquiry\nPast Medical History\nDrug History\nPregnancy/Birth & Neonatal History\nImmunization History\nDietary History\nDevelopmental History\nFamily History\nSocial History\nSummary\n\n\n1.3.1 Informant\nThe role and importance of an informant in paediatric history are as follows:\n\nTo help with the provision of history. In infants and young children, the history is essentially given by the informant. In older children and adolescents, the sick child could contribute to the history.\nTo be reasonably sure whether the history so obtained is reliable or not\n\nThe following information should be requested of the informant regarding themselves: their name, relationship to the patient, level of education, and whether they witnessed the current illness from its onset.\n\n\n1.3.2 Demographics of Patient\nThis should cover the patient’s name, sex, age, residential address, religion, and NHIS enrolment.  The importance of patients’ demographics is foremost for patient identification. Additionally, the sex & age of a patient may point to certain disease types and rule out others. For example, an infant girl straining at micturition has a form of urethral obstruction, but it cannot be a posterior urethral valve since PUV occurs exclusively in males.  Similarly, bronchiolitis is not a usual consideration for a 5-year-old with cough, breathlessness, and wheeze since bronchiolitis occurs almost always in children under 2 years old. The residential address can help identify the diseases to which the patient is at risk. For example, a patient may be residing in an area where certain diseases are endemic. For patients coming from a slum, the insanitary conditions and congestion predispose them to diarrhoeal and skin diseases.\nNote: A family’s religion may warn about potential conflicts with certain treatments, such as blood transfusions. Having an active insurance plan ensures the affordability of care to some extent.\n\n\n1.3.3 Presenting Complaint (PC) or Chief Complaint\nThis elicits the symptoms the patient is presenting with, together with their duration, in a chronological manner. The importance of the presenting complaint lies in its ability to open up the whole history to the system(s) involved in the disease process and the potential disease under discussion. It serves as the gateway to the disease process under review, as every disease manifests in its unique way. Identifying the system(s) involved allows asking further questions about that system in direct questioning (ODQ).\n\n\n1.3.4 History of Presenting Complaint(HPC)\nThis provides detailed accounts of each symptom reported in the PC, presented in chronological order. It also gives details of the characteristics of the symptoms, relieving and aggravating factors, as well as treatments that have been sought so far. The importance of the HPC is to obtain a complete picture of each symptom. The characteristics of the symptoms may provide clues to the disease under review.\n\n\n1.3.5 On Direct Questioning (ODQ)\nThis is a focused questioning technique that asks for further symptoms from the system(s) implicated by the presenting complaint, to narrow down to the likely diagnosis. Where no particular system is identified, direct questioning is conducted to identify the likely system of infection or inflammation. For example, if fever is the only symptom presented in the presenting complaint (PC), direct questioning is conducted to identify the likely system of infection or inflammation. For instance, symptoms suggestive of infection in the respiratory, gastrointestinal (GIT), musculoskeletal, central nervous system (CNS), genitourinary, ear, nose, and throat (ENT), etc., should be asked to narrow down to the likely disease. If any positive symptom is elicited in the ODQ, its duration and characteristics should be stated as well.\n\n\n1.3.6 Systemic Enquiry (Review of Systems)\nThis section examines the “unaffected systems” to determine if they are involved (through concurrent diseases or as a result of complications from the primary disease). Here, key diagnostic symptoms are asked in each of the systems (GIT, cardiovascular, respiratory, CNS, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, integumentary, endocrine). Review of Systems also allows obtaining all the symptoms the patient has (e.g., in case we did not take note of some symptoms the informant mentioned in the PC, or the informant stopped short of all the symptoms the patient had)\n\n\n1.3.7 Past Medical History\nThis section assesses four (4) things:\n\nAny medical condition the patient is known to have, current or previous, e.g., sickle cell disease, Asthma, Epilepsy, Tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes, etc.\nPrevious hospital admissions, and if so, when and for what condition?\nPrevious blood transfusion\nIf the condition s/he is currently presenting with has occurred in the past. This is important as the recurrence of a symptom may give a clue to diagnosis. For example, recurrence of bodily swelling may point to relapsing nephrotic syndrome, and recurrence of afebrile seizure may point to epilepsy.\n\n\n\n1.3.8 Drug History\nThis section assesses four (4) things:\n\nMedications taken so far for this current illness (usually captured in the HPC)\nWhether a patient is on long-term medications. This may give a clue to an underlying medical condition, even if the informant failed to mention the condition in the past medical history\nAny known drug & food allergies. If a patient has known allergies and a doctor fails to extract that information and goes ahead to give that forbidden medication, the practitioner may be liable for disciplinary actions and even prosecution should the patient suffer grave effects of the allergy.\nAny herbal medications, habitually or acutely, for this illness.  The importance is that the herbs may be responsible for the illness under review, since the potential toxic effects of most herbs have not been elucidated and documented, unlike orthodox medicine, whose side effects could easily be elucidated\n\n\n\n1.3.9 Pregnancy, Birth & Neonatal History\nThis section assesses the patient’s history during their conception, delivery, and neonatal life. It is not the pregnancy that the mother may be carrying at the time of clerking the sick child. The importance lies in the fact that any disease a mother suffered during pregnancy could affect the offspring of that pregnancy. The same applies to the consequences of labor and delivery, as well as the neonatal life of that child. The following information should be sought for in the pregnancy, labour, and neonatal life:\n\n1.3.9.1 Pregnancy\nWhen booking for antenatal care (ANC) was done, any significant diseases encountered by the mother during that pregnancy (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, rash, febrile illness, jaundice, admissions, and if so, for what condition) should be noted. Febrile illness, rash, and jaundice could all point to a possible TORCH infection in the mother. Whether the pregnancy was carried to term or not should be inquired about.\n\n\n1.3.9.2 Birth\nThe gestation of that pregnancy (term or not), the mode of delivery of that child (spontaneous vaginal, induced labor, C/S, etc.), the baby’s condition at delivery, whether the baby cried at birth, whether the baby needed resuscitation, and how soon after birth the baby was discharged could all indicate how well or otherwise the baby was at birth. The birth weight should also be asked for.\n\n\n1.3.9.3 The Neonatal Life\nAny neonatal illnesses. In particular,  jaundice, febrile illness, or admissions would be important to ask.\n\n\n\n1.3.10 Immunization\n Immunization is an important tool in preventing infectious diseases in children. A child who is not immunized is at significant risk of acquiring a severe form of infectious disease and of dying within the first few years of life. It is essential to determine whether the child’s immunization is up to date or completed, based on the child’s age and the national immunization schedule. This information should be cross-checked with the immunization card, if available. The presence of a BCG scar should be checked to ensure that at least some vaccinations have been initiated. Also, a BCG scar failure in those immunized may lead to failure of BCG immunization in a tiny minority. If some immunizations are detected to have been missed, the reasons for the missed immunizations should be investigated, and if it is still within the appropriate vaccination age, the child should be administered those immunizations.\n\n\n1.3.11 Dietary History\nSince children are growing species that require nutrients for both growth and development, a comprehensive dietary history is a key component of the pediatric history. Information to be sought under this section includes: the breastfeeding history (in all cases) and a typical 24-hour dietary history, with an emphasis on complete meals rather than just the main food type, e.g., rice with tomato stew and fish for lunch, rather than just “rice”. The meal should be assessed for both quality (balanced meal) and quantity. For toddlers, types of complementary foods and frequency of feeds, including night feeds, should be sought. Fruits and Snack intake (meals taken in between main meals) should all be assessed. Whether a child was fed breastmilk exclusively or was exposed to cow’s milk early in life has implications for diseases in later childhood, e.g., allergic conditions, metabolic conditions, etc, hence the importance of breastfeeding history in all cases.\n\n\n1.3.12 Developmental History\nAt any point in a child’s life, their level of development must be assessed to determine whether they are progressing at an appropriate rate for their age.\nFour areas of development should be assessed, namely:\n\nGross motor development, e.g., sitting, standing, walking\nFine motor development (use of hands in coordination with vision)\nHearing & Speech development\nSocial development (interactions with parents & others + bladder and bowel control/continence)\n\nWhere a developmental abnormality is detected, it is essential to review the pregnancy, birth, neonatal history, as well as nutritional and past medical history, to identify potential insults to the brain that may have occurred during this period.\n\n\n1.3.13 Family History\nThe family history assesses for any diseases in the family that could potentially have been transmitted to the patient, either through heredity or environmental factors (common risk factors). In particular, diseases such as sickle cell disease, asthma, epilepsy, tuberculosis, HIV, hypertension, and diabetes in a parent or sibling are important to inquire about. Acute illnesses, such as a runny nose, diarrhea, and febrile convulsions (if a child has a history of these), would also be important to note from the family. The family tree may be assessed in the family history or under the social history, as given below.\n\n\n1.3.14 Social History\nThe family’s social status is a significant predictor of risk factors for the child’s disease, as well as the family’s ability to manage the prescribed treatment effectively.  \nInformation sought for under the social history covers the following six (6) areas:\n\nParents: their ages, level of education, and occupation. Whether they are in a stable marriage or not. If a parent has passed, the circumstances of their passing and the likely cause should be sought.\nSiblings: Number, ages, and sexes, as well as their current school status. If a sibling has passed away, the circumstances of their passing should be noted.\nResidential facility: The number of sleeping rooms, the number of people who sleep with the patient, the ventilation of the room (including windows), and the use of mosquito nets.\nWater & Sewage: Source of drinking water, toilet facilities, and means of waste disposal\nFinancial support for the child’s upkeep\nSocial habits of parents like smoking & drinking (Home environmental risk factors for diseases, e.g., a child heavily exposed to smoking will be at risk of respiratory diseases like asthma and pneumonia)\n\n\n\n1.3.15 Summary of History\nThe summary uses not only the symptoms elicited but also any other relevant information obtained from any segment of the history that is worthy of note. Typically, it mentions the patient’s name, age, presenting complaint, and all other essential information in a sentence or two.",

    "title": "1  Child History & Examination",
    "section": "1.4 Physical Examination",
    "text": "1.4 Physical Examination\nThis follows after obtaining the comprehensive history. Always begins the physical examination with Anthropometry:\n\nWeight, weight-for-age SD score, its interpretation (normal, abnormal, etc)\nHeight, height-for-age SD score, its interpretation (normal, abnormal, etc)\nWeight-for-height SD score (for children up to 5 years), its interpretation (normal, abnormal, etc)\nBMI (for children &gt; 5 years), BMI-for-age centile, its interpretation (normal, abnormal, etc)\nMid-Upper-Arm-Circumference (MUAC, for 6 months to 5 years), its interpretation\nHead circumference percentile (for children up to 5 years) and what it means\n\n Of note, WHO simplifies the definitions of anthropometry as follows:\nFindings outside the borders of -2SD and +2SD are abnormal, and values -2SD to +2SD are normal. If the values are outside -3SD and +3SD, then they are severely abnormal, e.g., moderate underweight if WFA is &lt; -2SD, severe underweight if WFA &lt;-3SD, overweight if WFA &gt;+2SD, and obese if WFA &gt;+3SD.\nVital Signs: Temperature, Pulse rate, volume & rhythm, Respiratory rate, Oxygen saturation (SPO2), Blood Pressure\n\n1.4.1 General Examination\nThis assessment evaluates the general state of the patient, including their appearance, distress level, position in bed, nutritional status, state of consciousness, and other relevant factors. It then assesses for pallor, jaundice, lymph node enlargement, pedal edema, hydration status, warmth in the hands, capillary refill, clubbing, or any other stigmata of disease. Additionally, it examines the skin for rashes, pigmentation, and any eruptions.\n\n\n1.4.2 System-by-System Examination\nThis should cover at least the four major systems: Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal/Abdomen, and the central nervous system. Note that all four systems must be examined for every case clerked, regardless of the system affected by the disease. Other systems to note include the musculoskeletal, genitourinary, integumentary (comprising skin and mucous membranes), and endocrine systems.\n\n1.4.2.1 Respiratory System Examination\nInspection: Always begin by assessing the respiratory rate and respiratory effort (quiet or distressful). Then check for cyanosis and the shape of the chest.\nPalpation: Palpate the chest wall for tenderness, centrality of the trachea, and lymph nodes (if not already assessed during the general examination). Additionally, assess chest expansion (for older children only) and tactile fremitus (for older children only).\nPercussion: The percussion fingers should always be placed horizontally along the intercostal spaces and NEVER across the ribs or scapulae. All chest zones, anteriorly, posteriorly, and laterally, should be percussed. It is more convenient to finish the anterior and lateral chest examination before moving to the back. \nAuscultation: The assessment should report on the volume of air (adequacy of air entering lungs), nature of breath sounds, any additional sounds, and vocal fremitus\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Cardiovascular System Examination\nA convenient style of cardiovascular examination is to move from the hands (for warmth, CRT, clubbing, and cyanosis), wrist (for pulse), arm (for blood pressure), neck (for distended veins), and then settle on the heart or coronary arteries. However, the patient’s general position in bed (propped up or not), use of supplementary oxygen, respiratory effort, and mouth for central cyanosis should all be noted, if not already captured during the general examination.\n\n\n1.4.4 The COR/Heart\nInspection: Inspect for any bulge, precordial pulsations\nPalpation: Palpate for the Apex beat, heaves, and thrills\nAuscultation: Auscultate over all four areas for quality of the heart sounds 1 & 2, rhythm of the heartbeat, murmurs, and any added sounds. If a murmur is detected, its characteristics must be reported, and the point of maximal sound (which may indicate the valve affected or position of a shunt lesion) as well as its radiation.\nTypically, there is no percussion in COR examination!\n\n\n1.4.5 Gastrointestinal System Examination\nA typical GIT examination is from mouth to anus, covering the abdomen (liver and intestines).\nHowever, GIT examination may be limited to the Abdomen.\n\n\n1.4.6 Abdominal Examination\nInspection: Exposure - The abdomen should be reasonably exposed from the nipple level down to both inguinal creases. The genitals must be covered for privacy, but must be inspected. The size of the abdomen (using the chest wall as a reference, both anteroposteriorly and laterolaterally), position of the umbilicus, movement with respiration, presence or absence of distended veins or scars, and the presence of hernia orifices should be commented on. If the patient is edematous, check for edema of the genitals.\nPalpation: Perform light palpation to assess tenderness in all nine regions. If masses are detected during this examination, they should be reported. Deep palpation for the Liver, Spleen, kidneys, and any other masses felt during light palpation\nPercussion: Percuss for fluid (use shifting dullness if the fluid is judged to be mild to moderate, and use fluid thrill if the fluid is judged to be severe). Always percuss at the level of the umbilicus with the fingers spread out.\nIf percussion note is tympanitic across the hemi-abdomen to the flank, there is no fluid. If it is dull all through, then the abdomen may be full of fluid, in which case, fluid thrill will be preferred to use. If there is perceived dullness at the flank but the dull note does not change to tympanitic at the shift of the patient to the opposite site, then there is no fluid in the abdomen.\nAuscultation: Auscultate for bowel sounds by using the diaphragm of the stethoscope around the umbilicus. Report on the presence or absence of bowel sounds and their pitch. Bowel sound auscultation is typically performed over 2 minutes. If no bowel sounds are heard over this period, the bowel sounds are presumed to be absent. In some cases, bruit can also be auscultated.\n\n\n1.4.7 Central Nervous System Physical Examination\nHere, five (5) areas should be examined and reported on, namely:\n\nThe level of Consciousness: The Blantyre coma scale may be used (for children under 5 years) or the modified Glasgow coma scale.\nSigns of meningeal irritation: Check for Neck stiffness, Kernig’s sign, and Brudzinski’s sign. Bulging fontanel may be elicited in babies, but this is often a late sign. Fever with irritability is a specific indicator of meningitis in this special group.\nCranial nerves examination: Examination of the cranial nerves should be performed\nMotor system: Assess for the Tone, Power & Reflexes [TPR])\nSensory system: Assess fine and deep touch, coordination, gait, and joint position sense",

For example, antibiotics for infectious diseases\nSupportive treatment: Those treatments that relieve symptoms. For example, analgesics for pain, antipyretics for fever\nNote on Empiric Treatment: At the point of provisional diagnosis, while awaiting confirmation of the disease through appropriate diagnostic investigations, treatment is usually initiated based on the most likely anticipated diagnosis. Such treatment intervention is called empiric treatment. For infectious diseases in which cultures have been taken and the results are waiting, the likely isolate with known antibiotic susceptibility is usually initiated, which will be reviewed either for continuation or discontinuation based on the culture and sensitivity results obtained.\nEmergency management:\nWhere a case is life-threatening and requires emergency intervention, it may not be necessary to wait and go through the details of clerking outlined above. In such emergency cases, a brief history may be taken, and depending on the life-threatening issues identified, emergency interventions may be instituted to stabilize the patient before proceeding with a full clinical review.\nUSEFUL BOOKS\nClinical Methods by Hutchison and Macleod",

As medical students in Ghana, it is crucial to comprehend the physiological processes of growth and development, their milestones, and how socio-economic and environmental factors specific to Ghana impact these processes.\nGrowth refers to an increase in physical size (height, weight, head circumference). In contrast, development refers to the acquisition of skills and functions such as motor abilities, language, cognition, and social behaviour. Both occur simultaneously and are influenced by genetic, nutritional, hormonal, environmental, and psychosocial factors.",

Health and Disease\n\nFrequent infections (malaria, diarrheal disease, respiratory infections) affect growth.\nHelminthic infestations (e.g., Ascaris, hookworm) can cause anemia and malabsorption.\nHIV and chronic illnesses impact weight gain and development.\n\n3. Immunization\n\nVaccines under Ghana’s EPI (Expanded Programme on Immunization) protect against major childhood illnesses.\nDelays in vaccination can predispose children to infections that impair growth.\n\n4. Socioeconomic Status\n\nPoverty, poor housing, and low parental education levels contribute to undernutrition and developmental delays.\nUrban-rural disparities exist, with rural children at higher risk of poor outcomes.\n\n5. Environmental Factors\n\nPoor sanitation increases the risk of repeated infections.\nEnvironmental toxins (e.g., lead exposure in certain mining communities) can cause neurodevelopmental issues.\n\n6. Parental Care and Stimulation\n\nEmotional support, play, and verbal interaction are key for early brain development.\nNeglect, abuse, and trauma can lead to delayed speech and cognitive skills",

These settings bear the highest burden of severe acute illness and life-threatening injuries. Still, due to underappreciation of its importance, critical care has not been incorporated as an essential part of the health system.(Sakaan et al. 2022)\nAn infant, child, or adolescent with an illness, injury, or post-operative state that increases the risk for or results in acute physiological instability (abnormal vital signs, laboratory values, or clinical findings) falls under acute paediatric critical illness.(Appiah et al. 2018)\n\nMany paediatric lives can be saved with low-cost resuscitation techniques and procedures, supportive care and referral pathways available at all levels of care. Over sixty per cent of children die because of poor emergency and critical care. SDG may not be achieved unless PECC service is available to every acutely ill child.\nBy providing prompt and adequate medical care to critically ill children, paediatric emergency and critical care services can contribute to a decrease in childhood death rates.",

Any space available should and can be used to offer such services. In that sense, any clinician can advocate for or institute measures to provide PECC.\nThe following are typical reasons for PICU admissions:\n\nAcute respiratory distress and failure e.g., (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, severe exacerbations of asthma, or any cause are all considered respiratory distress.\nShock: hypovolemic shock, septic shock, (e.g., from severe dehydration or haemorrhage). cardiogenic shock (e.g., from myocarditis or heart failure),\nTrauma: accidental and non-accidental polytrauma injuries, burns, or other causes.\nNeurological emergencies: Seizures, severe brain damage, cerebral bleeding, meningitis, or encephalitis are examples.\nCardiovascular: Heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and exacerbations of congenital heart disease are examples.\nSepsis: Systemic infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi that result in septic shock or sepsis.\nMetabolic disorders include metabolic acidosis, severe electrolyte imbalances, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and inborn metabolic abnormalities.\nConditions that result in the failure or dysfunction of numerous organ systems, including multiple organ failure, are called multi-organ dysfunction.\nPost-operative support: Children undergoing difficult procedures, especially those requiring close cardiovascular monitoring of organ function.\nHaematological and oncological disorders: coagulation issues, thrombocytopenia, or severe anaemia, side effects of cancer treatment, such as tumour lysis syndrome or neutropenia caused by chemotherapy.\nExposure to poisonous substances, overdosing, or poisoning are examples of toxicological emergencies.\nEndocrine: include thyroid storm, adrenal crises, and diabetic emergencies.\nGastrointestinal: intussusception, typhoid ileal perforation, necrotizing enterocolitis, or extreme dehydration are examples of.\nRenal disorders: include electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney damage, and renal failure.",

The clinical plan that is frequently applied in emergency and critical care settings for children:\nInitial assessment and stabilisation\nABCDE technique: This methodical technique entails evaluating the airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure.\nA – check for airway patency. Determine at risk or not at risk of obstruction.\nB – the breathing sufficient\nC – assess circulation for perfusion\nD – evaluate the neurological status using GCS or AVPU\nE – expose the infant while keeping them warm.\n\n\nVital Signs: Take your blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, oxygen saturation and pain score assessment.\nDuring this assessment, any irregularities ought to be taken care of right away before the next category is done.\n\n5.3.1 History\nA focused history that covers the child’s presenting complaints, medical history, current medications, recent illnesses, immunization status, and events leading up to the current presentation should be obtained from caregivers.\nInquire about symptoms like fever, coughing, breathing problems diarrhoeaa, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, trauma, or toxin intake.\n\n\n5.3.2 Physical examination\nExamine the child thoroughly, beginning with a general assessment of their look and state of consciousness.\nPerform a comprehensive examination from head to toe, encompassing evaluation of the respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, abdominal, cardiovascular, renal, and musculoskeletal systems.\nKeep an eye out for symptoms of trauma, dehydration, altered mental status, cyanosis, irregular breath sounds, abnormal heart sounds, and respiratory distress.\n\n\n5.3.3 Focused assessment and investigations\n\nPrioritize testing including blood tests (e.g., complete blood count, electrolytes, blood gas analysis), imaging studies (e.g., chest X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan), and\nother tests (e.g., ECG, echocardiogram, lumbar puncture) based on the first assessment and history.\nIf available and appropriate, take into consideration bedside testing such as point-of-care ultrasound or quick diagnostics for infectious disorders.\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Management and treatment\nBased on the results of the diagnostic tests and clinical findings, begin the necessary treatment. This can involve the use of supportive care measures, oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, and drug delivery (such as antibiotics, inotropes, analgesia and sedatives).\nPrioritize treating life-threatening disorders including shock, respiratory failure, and obstruction of the airway.\n\n\n5.3.5 Monitoring and reassessment\nMonitoring is a cardinally important part of critical care. It allows for evaluation of the patient’s response to interventions. Patients with critical illness or injury require more frequent monitoring in the first 24-48 to identify deterioration patients or those not responding to treatment. Keep a close eye on the child’s vital signs, reaction to therapies, and general state of health.\nRegularly reevaluate the child and modify the management plan in response to treatment response and changes in the child’s clinical status. If resources permit all patients should be on patient monitor for continuous vital signs evaluation. Additional staffing may be required or assigned to monitor and alert other clinicians of abnormal values. This will ensure a timely response.\n\n\n5.3.6 Multi-disciplinary and referral\nCritical illness may involve or result or lead to multiple pathologies as a result multidisciplinary team approach to care cannot be over-emphasised. If additional evaluation and management are needed, consult with the appropriate specialists (paediatric surgeons, paediatric intensivists, neurologists, infectious disease specialists, etc.).\nMDT in critical care involves discussing patients in detail with the appropriate specialist(s) to determine the best care for the desired outcome. If the child’s condition calls for specialized interventions or resources not provided by the current facility, consider transferring to a higher level of care.\n\n\n5.3.7 Family centred care\nThe family’s role in providing care for a sick child must always be considered during management. Recall that the patient is best known by their parents, guardians, or relatives. Their engagement from the patient’s history to recognizing and comprehending their condition will be optimal.\nInvolve caregivers in decision-making wherever possible, respecting their choices and cultural views. Communicate effectively with the child’s caregivers, giving them updates on the child’s status, outlining the planned interventions, and answering any worries or questions they may have.",

    "text": "5.4 Interventions\nChildren who are critically ill require emergent and timely life-sustaining interventions. Resuscitation and supportive care are two interventions that are usually utilized to revive patients and assist vital organs to recover until they can function within the survivable level.\n\n5.4.1 Resuscitation\nThe process of treating a critically ill patient’s physiological abnormalities is known as resuscitation, and it occurs in every hospital department. It involves various methods that call for a broad range of capabilities that have been systematically developed and applied over time.(Arias et al. 2024)\nIt refers to the act of reviving someone from apparent death or unconsciousness because of cardiorespiratory arrest, often involving procedures such as chest compression, ventilation, cardiac massage, and the use of a defibrillator.(Lewis and McConnell 2018)\nClinical presentation of cardiac arrest in children presents differently from adults. Cardiac (shock), respiratory (respiratory tract infection) and gastrointestinal (diarrhoea and vomiting) conditions are the common predisposing risks that get children into cardiorespiratory arrest.(Meghani 2021) Children frequently move to cardiac arrest through respiratory or circulatory failure, the pre-arrest period in children is typically characterized by respiratory distress or failure, shock, or a combination of these factors.\n\n\n5.4.2 Critical organ dysfunction or failure\nManifestation of children’s pre-cardiac arrest stage includes:\n\nRespiratory distress\n\nIncreased work of breathing: Using auxiliary muscles, nasal flaring, grunting, and retractions (intercostal, subcostal, and suprasternal).\nAbnormal breath sounds including crackles, stridor, wheezing, or reduced breath sounds.\nAlterations in breathing pattern: Bradypnea (slow breathing) or tachypnoea (fast breathing).\n\nRespiratory failure\n\nCyanosis: Bluish discolouration of the skin, especially around the lips and fingertips, indicating hypoxemia.\nAltered Mental Status: Lethargy, irritability, or unresponsiveness due to inadequate oxygenation.\nApnoea: Periods of stopped breathing or significant pauses in breathing.\n\nCirculatory impairment/failure (shock)\n\nTachycardia or abnormally rapid heart rate is frequently the result of an early compensatory mechanism.\nHypotension: Low blood pressure in children is a late and concerning sign.\nPoor perfusion: Cold, clammy skin; longer than two seconds for capillary refill; sluggish or non-existent peripheral pulses.\nAltered mental status: Incomprehension, agitation, or a reduction in reactivity.\n\nNeurological dysfunction\n\nAltered Mental State: Diminished level of alertness, agitation, or lethargy.\nSeizures: In children with known seizure disorders, a new or alterations in seizure patterns.\n\nVital Sign Changes\n\nAbnormal Heart Rate: Tachycardia is common, whilst bradycardia is usually a late sign suggesting severe deterioration.\nAbnormal Respiratory Rate: Both tachypnoea and bradypnea are worrying.\nHypotension: in children, it is frequently a late sign of shock.\n\nLaboratory and Monitoring Data:\n\nHypoxemia: arterial saturation as measured by pulse oximetry.\nHypercapnia: Elevated carbon dioxide readings, indicating inadequate ventilation.\nMetabolic Acidosis: Blood gas analysis shows a drop in blood pH and bicarbonate levels, indicating poor tissue perfusion and oxygenation.\n\n\nManagement of pre-cardiac arrest and cardiac arrest involves prevention by identifying patients at risk, monitoring and managing complications, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and in advanced cases supportive care,\n\n\n5.4.3 Early Recognition and Monitoring:\n\nFrequent or continuous monitoring of vital signs, including HR, RR, CRT, and SpO2 with or without BP.\nRepeated assessments of mental status and perfusion indicators.\nFollowing assessment and monitoring, any abnormalities should be responded to with appropriate interventions such as low SpO2 should be given oxygen and respiratory support for respiratory failure.\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Supportive therapy\nAside from resuscitation among patients with cardiac arrest, those in pre-arrest or return of spontaneous circulation post-resuscitation need supportive care.\nRespiratory Support:\n\nProviding oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation (e.g., CPAP or BiPAP), or mechanical ventilation if needed.\nClearing airway obstructions and ensuring proper airway management.\n\nCirculatory Support:\n\nAdministering fluids judiciously to treat hypovolemia.\nUsing vasoactive medications like epinephrine or norepinephrine for shock.\n\nTreating Underlying Causes:\n\n\n5.4.5 Optimisation of oxygen delivery\nPrevention of cardiac arrest or restoration after cardiac arrest of a patient to health requires optimisation of the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and flow of blood to the tissues. These require\n\nProvide oxygen to the lungs so that red blood cells can take it\nSufficient haemoglobin levels to bind oxygen\nImprove cardiac contractility to guarantee enough blood pumping optimum vascular tone for all tissue beds to be perfused\nEffective intravascular volume to provide sufficient blood flow to the heart’s right side.\n\nChildren with critical illness require early identification, institution of timely intervention, assessment and effective monitoring.  Understanding the complex interaction of clinical, infrastructural, workforce, family, and systemic factors affects the outcomes of pediatric critical illness in hospitals. Improving these parameters using focused interventions, distribution of resources, education, and modifications to policies can greatly enhance the standard of care and survival rates for children with critical illness.\n\n\n\n\nAppiah, J A, S Salie, A Argent, and B Morrow. 2018. “Characteristics, Course and Outcomes of Children Admitted to a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit After Cardiac Arrest.” Southern African Journal of Critical Care 34 (2): 58. https://doi.org/10.7196/sajcc.2018.v34i2.355.\n\n\nArias, Anita V, Michael Lintner-Rivera, Nadeem I Shafi, Qalab Abbas, Abdelhafeez H Abdelhafeez, Muhammad Ali, Halaashuor Ammar, et al. 2024. “A Research Definition and Framework for Acute Paediatric Critical Illness Across Resource-Variable Settings: A Modified Delphi Consensus.” The Lancet Global Health 12 (2): e331–40. https://doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(23)00537-5.\n\n\nLewis, Grant, and Paul McConnell. 2018. “Ethical Issues in Resuscitation and Intensive Care.” Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine 19 (12): 644–47. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpaic.2018.09.004.\n\n\nMeghani, Shaista. 2021. “Witnessed Resuscitation: A Concept Analysis.” Intensive and Critical Care Nursing 64 (June): 103003. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2020.103003.\n\n\nSakaan, Firas, Adrian Holloway, Qalab Abbas, John Appiah, Jonah Attebery, Paula Caporal, Ericka Fink, et al. 2022. “643: ESTIMATING THE GLOBAL PREVALENCE OF PEDIATRIC ACUTE CRITICAL ILLNESS IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS.” Critical Care Medicine 51 (1): 311–11. https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000908304.12117.81.",

    "text": "6.3 Shock\n\n6.3.1 Definition\nShock is an acute process characterised by the body’s inability to deliver adequate oxygen to meet the metabolic demands of vital organs and tissues.\n\n\n6.3.2 Pathophysiology\nAmong the key functions of the CVS is the delivery of blood to tissues, and perfusion. Figure 6.1 summarizes the concept of oxygen delivery and adequate blood flow to the tissues with enough oxygen in the blood. This ensures that oxygen and nutrients are sent to the tissues to meet metabolic demands. Blood flow is dependent on stroke volume (mechanical function of the heart) and blood oxygen content of blood. Failure of the CVS to perform this function results in an imbalance in oxygen supply and tissue demand leading to anaerobic metabolism. This alternative energy production pathway to sustain life is associated with unwanted metabolites including lactic acid disturbing the homeostasis environment. When prolonged and not reversed promptly it usually leads to irreversible tissue damage and ultimately, death. Shock is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and a leading cause of emergency and intensive care unit admission. Stroke volume is dependent on the volume of blood at the end-diastole (preload), cardiac muscle integrity (myocardial contractility) and the resistance against which the heart pumps (afterload)  is influenced by Oxygen carried by haemoglobin (Hb X Arterial oxygen saturation, SpO2) + Dissolved oxygen in the blood (0.003 × Arterial partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2). The oxygen delivery to tissues equation is represented by\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Oxygen delivery (DO2) equation\n\n\n\n\nCO = Cardiac output, CaO2 = arterial oxygen content, HR = Heart rate, SV = stroke volume, SpO2 = arterial oxygen saturation, PaO2 = partial pressure of arterial oxygen tension.\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Clinical stages of shock\nIn impaired hemodynamic states, the body is not able to deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. This results in a cascade of biomedical processes initiated by anaerobic metabolism and if not corrected the processes lead to vascular endothelial injury and irreversible damage Figure 2. Shock may be categorized into stages to assist with diagnosis and management\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Stages of shock with characteristics and clinical features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\nPathophysiology\nClinical Features\n\n\n\n\nPre-shock\nThere is impaired hemodynamic status, but the body can fall on its physiological reserve and intrinsic autoregulation to compensate mechanisms to attenuate its untoward undesired effect.\nTachycardia, Tachypnoea, Cool core to periphery temperature\n\n\nShock\nEnsues when the compensatory reserve is exhausted with full-blown clinical manifestation of the cardiovascular system\nAbove plus Capillary refill time &gt; 3 seconds, +/- hypotension\n\n\nEnd-organ dysfunction or failure\nDuring this stage distant organs are affected. Usually, the terminal process results from loss of autoregulation leading to death or permanent organ damage in patients who survive.\nNeurology (altered level of consciousness) Genito-urinary (reduced urine output) Laboratory (evidence of organ dysfunction - liver, renal, coagulation etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Classification\n\nAt the bedside, shock is conveniently classified as either compensated or uncompensated. The former refers to the early stages of shock when the body can mount a response to maintain perfusion. Uncompensated shock refers to the loss of the body’s compensatory response.\nOther classifications based on core-to-peripheral body temperature are cold and warm shock. Clinical presentation may vary depending on the state of the patient and may drift in and out of these classifications. Without intervention and monitoring for stability, there should not be seen an improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A(Shock states with low perfusion)--&gt;B(Inadequate oxygen delivery);\n    B--&gt;C(Anaerobic metabolism);\n    C--&gt;D(Increased Lactate);\n    C--&gt;E(Free radical);\n    C--&gt;F(Immune response);\n    E--&gt;G(Energy dependent ion &lt;br&gt; gated function loss, &lt;br&gt; microcirculation failure );\n    E--&gt;H(Cellular death);\n    F--&gt;H;\n    F--&gt;I(Vascular dysregulation &lt;br&gt; and coagulopathy);\n    G--&gt;J(Fluid leak,vasodilataion, &lt;br&gt; tissue swelling);\n    H--&gt;K(Vital organ damage);\n    I--&gt;L(Disseminated intravascular &lt;br&gt; coagulopathy);\n    G--&gt;H\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Simplified cascade processes resulting from shock hypoxia, free radical formation, and hypoxia lead to inefficient anaerobic metabolism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.5 Types of Shock\nBased on etiology shock may grouped into 5:\n\nHypovolemic shock - the most common cause of shock in paediatrics. There is a reduction in venous return (preload) as a result of internal or external losses. Can be from fluid loss/redistribution, e.g. Vomiting, diarrhoea, burns, third-spacing, blood loss/hemorrhagic shock from trauma, Gastrointestinal bleeds.\nCardiogenic shock- cardiac pump failure secondary to poor myocardial function. E.g. congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopathies- acute myocarditis, and arrhythmias.\nIn obstructive shock any mechanical impediment to adequate cardiac output. Eg. Tension pneumothorax, massive pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade.\nDistributive shock- inadequate vasomotor tone, severe vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability resulting in fluid moving into the interstitium. Examples include f anaphylactic and shock neurogenic shock.\nSeptic shock is usually associated with a combination of distributive, hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock.",

    "text": "6.4 Case discussion\nAccording to the World Health Organization, shock may be clinically diagnosed when there are cold extremities, a capillary refill time of more than 3 seconds, and a fast weak pulse. Hypotension is usually a late sign and not a requirement to diagnose shock promptly. Additional signs attributed to other organs impacted are\n\naltered mental status,\nlow urine output,\nrising liver enzymes, lactic acidosis or base deficit,\nlow mixed and central venous oxygen saturation.\n\nThe 7-month-old baby presents with cold extremities, tachycardia, and slow delayed refill time consistent with shock. It is important to know the aetiology to manage appropriately. Hypovolemia, septic shock, and obstructive may be implicated as the causes of this child’s current condition.\n\nThe history of the illness includes fever cough, poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea.\nFever, poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea suggest possible fluid losses and therefore hypovolemia.\nSimilarly, fever and features suggestive of infection could result from sepsis as a cause of the shock.\nThe cough, respiratory distress requiring oxygen, a hint of respiratory tract infection and possible complications such as pneumothorax.\nLastly, penicillin causes anaphylaxis hence there is a potential anaphylactic.\n\nThe most probable cause of this infant’s shock is septic shock. Given fever, poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea the child may have low intravascular volume.  The suspected infection has progressed to severe disease and the release of cytokines and other immune responses at the tissue and cellular level leading to damaged endothelium and consequently fluid leak from the intracellular space. Inflammatory response and endotoxins may damage vasodilation and myocardium with myocardial dysfunction.\nThe combination of these processes compromises perfusion to the tissues all tissues especially vital organs, the brain, kidney, liver and coagulation. A four-organ system model which included criteria for respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and neurologic dysfunction has been developed to guide the diagnosis of sepsis. Whilst diagnosing sepsis at this point may still not be early enough, the new criteria provide new evidence that should sensitize clinicians to pick patients with infection who are critically ill.\nAcute gastroenteritis is the most common cause of shock in children. Patients rapidly advance to dehydration and shock because of loss of intravascular volume\n\n6.4.1 Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis\nShock is a clinical diagnosis based on history and examination. It is dependent on underlying pathology but there are overlaps in presentation.\n\n\n6.4.2 History\n\nHypovolemic shock- diarrhoea, vomiting, burns, bleeding, jaundice, trauma\nCardiogenic shock- known patient with congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathies, heart failure, easy fatiguability, darkened lips and fingers or toes, palpitations, chest pain, diaphoresis and taking frequent breaks during feeds\nDistributive shock- drug history, allergies, spinal surgery,\nSeptic shock- fever, cough, jaundice, diarrhoea, vomiting, difficulty in breathing, loss of consciousness, seizures,\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Examination\n\nTachycardia\nPoor peripheral perfusion- cold extremities, CRT&gt;3s, weak pulse volume\nRespiratory distress signs- tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, flaring of alae nasae, subcostal recession\nAltered mental status\nHypotension (a late sign)\nOliguria\nSigns of dehydration\n\nOther findings- jaundice, fever, skin lesions, chest signs of pneumonia or pneumothorax, upper airway obstruction murmurs or other heart sounds, signs of raised ICP, oedema, hypo/hyperglycemia, low SpO2 &lt;92%\n\n\n6.4.4 Approach to management\nShock is an emergency! Resuscitation must therefore be timely.\n\n\n6.4.5 Initial assessment\n\nTriage by following assessment and ensuring the airway is patent and maintainable, and breathing is appropriate for age.\nAdminister oxygen\nAdmit the patient to the emergency room.\nSecure intravenous access (preferably the largest vein possible). Intraosseous access is equally useful when IV is difficult to obtain.\nThe first line of most untreated shock is fluid. Recent evidence suggests that large fluid boluses increase mortality.\n\n5-10 ml/kg over 30 minutes, this may be repeated every 30 minutes as needed (non-dehydration related shock). Balanced crystalloids are the fluid of choice (Ringer’s lactate is the crystalloid of preferable), Normal saline may be used in patients with head injuries. Avoid in with or at risk of acute kidney injury.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.6 Second survey\nEvaluate the patient for causes of shock and treat accordingly.\n\nHypovolemic\n\nSevere dehydration because of acute gastroenteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting). Rehydrate using WHO Plan B or C as appropriate\nSevere anaemia – transfuse blood.\nHemorrhage – transfuse blood without blood products as needed\n\nMonitor response to the fluid bolus every 15 – 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n6.4.7 Investigations\nOnce the patient has been resuscitated tailored but detailed investigations are needed.\n\n6.4.7.1 Laboratory\n\nFBC- Anemia, Leukopenia/leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia\nArterial blood gases- acidosis (metabolic/respiratory), low PaO2, high/low PCO2, high lactate, high anion gap\nDeranged liver and renal function test\nAbnormal electrolytes (low Calcium, hyper/hypokalemia)\nAbnormal clotting profile\nSeptic screen - blood, urine, nasopharyngeal swabs, stool, CSF\nChest x-ray indicated suspected lung pathology such as pneumothorax and infections.\nEcho/ECG – useful for diagnosis and monitoring of shock\nNeuroimaging for suspected brain abscess, meningitis and encephalitis.\nMarkers of inflammation/infection- CRP, ESR and procalcitonin. These will be determined by circumstances. It may also be used to guide antibiotic therapy decisions.  \n\n\n\n\n6.4.8 Additional treatment\nFor shock not responding to fluid of 30-40 ml/kg the following may be added.\n\nCardiogenic shock - Inotropes to improve contractility– adrenaline or dobutamine.\nObstructive shock\n\nTension pneumothorax – thoracostomy/chest tube insertion\nmassive pulmonary embolism – anticoagulants\ncardiac tamponade - pericardiocentesis\n\nDistributive shock – adrenaline, phenylephrine\nSeptic shock\n\nFor fluid refractory - noradrenaline, adrenaline, dobutamine\nFor vasopressor and inotrope refractory - steroid stress dose\nAntimicrobial therapy in sepsis within an hour.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.9 Supportive therapy\nIn inotrope-refractory shock, steroids may be given for adrenal insufficiency.\n\nIntensive Care Unit admission as required\nNeuroprotective measures- normothermia, normoglycemia, anti-seizure(if indicated), hyperosmolar therapy\nProviding ventilatory support- invasive vs non-invasive\nWorsening cardiac function requires invasive treatment options like ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) and ventricular-assisted devices. The underlying cause should be looked at after resuscitation and stabilization\nCorrect all electrolyte abnormalities\nNutritional rehabilitation- early initiation of enteral feeds associated with good outcomes\nAnalgesia, antipyretics, anxiolytics. Hemotransfusion if indicated.",

It represents a time of rapid physiological adaptation from intrauterine to extrauterine life, with major changes occurring in respiration, circulation, nutrition, and thermoregulation. During this period, morbidity and mortality are highest compared to any other stage of childhood, particularly in low- and middle-income countries such as Ghana.\nFor clinicians, the neonatal history and examination are essential tools in identifying normal adaptation, detecting abnormalities early, and guiding timely interventions.

Risk factors include sepsis, Infant of a diabetic mother, prematurity, Intrauterine growth restriction, birth asphyxia and hypothermia. Signs include Lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, and apnea. Neurological damage may result from hypoglycemia in neonates.\nNeonatal hypoglycemia is most commonly seen in macrosomic infants and infants of diabetic mothers. For these babies, during pregnancy, maternal glucose crosses the placenta to cause fetal hyperglycaemia. The fetal pancreas responds by increasing insulin production. Following delivery, the hyperglycaemic stimulus is instantly removed but insulin production may take longer to slow down. This results in an increased risk and incidence of hypoglycemia at the early newborn period.\nManagement involves initially checking the airway, breathing and circulation. 2ml/kg of IV 10% Dextrose or 5ml/kg of 5% Dextrose may be given PR if IV access is unavailable. Ensure the baby has a normal body temperature (temperature target: 36.50 – 37.50C) as hypothermia prone the baby to hypoglycaemia.

    "text": "9.6 Neonatal Sepsis\nSepsis in the neonate kills more than a million babies worldwide every year. It is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs of infection with accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life. It can be categorized into Early Onset Neonatal Sepsis (EOS), which refers to the presence of signs of infection accompanied by a positive culture within the first 72 hours of life, and Late Onset Neonatal Sepsis (LOS), which signifies the onset of signs of infection with a positive culture after 72 hours of life.\nCausative organisms: Early-onset sepsis is typically caused by organisms from the maternal genital tract, whereas late-onset sepsis is caused by organisms in the caregiving environment or community. Common organisms are Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus among others. For many of these organisms, the resistance rate to antibiotics is alarmingly going up.\nAntenal risk factors known to be associated with neonatal jaundice include spontaneous rupture of membranes, less than 37 completed weeks of gestation, spontaneous preterm labour, rupture of membranes greater than 18 hours before delivery, maternal chorioamnionitis, maternal fever of 38 degrees Celsius or more, maternal invasive bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, pre-labour rupture of membranes, Group B Streptococcus infection in a previous baby, or current pregnancy, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and foul-smelling liquor.\nPostnatally, risk factors for neonatal sepsis include prolonged resuscitation at birth, prematurity, invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation, excessive handling, home delivery, lack of hand washing and inadequate Infection prevention control. Others include overcrowding and prolonged hospital stay.\nSigns of neonatal sepsis include\n\nAbnormal colour: Pale, cyanotic, mottled appearance, jaundice, grey\nTemperature instability\nAbdominal signs: distension, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhoea\nRespiratory: Apnea, respiratory distress, gasping (Abnormal breathing)\nHypo - or hyperglycemia\nCardiovascular: Shock, tachycardia (HR &gt; 180), Bradycardia (HR &lt; 80)\nAbnormal bleeding\nCentral Nervous System: Excessive crying, irritability, seizures, altered tone, lethargy,\n\nManagement of neonatal sepsis should be comprehensive. It should include an initial evaluation for resuscitation of the airway, breathing and circulation. Further, the blood sugar should be measured. Early reversal of the shock state by administering an initial bolus of 10ml/kg of crystalloid or its equivalent should be done in the shock present. Vasopressors or inotropes should be used in septic shock only after appropriate volume resuscitation has been done. The goals of the resuscitation should be Normal Cap refill (less than 2 seconds), normal pulses, warm extremities, and appropriate urine output (greater than 1mL/kg/hr).\nIncreased successful treatment of neonatal sepsis requires early recognition and urgent administration of appropriate antibiotics.\nAfter resuscitation, ongoing management usually starts with a detailed history to assess risk factors and other presentations. A thorough physical examination will then be performed, looking for and documenting specific signs indicating severity.\nInvestigations usually include a blood culture. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Ideally, a culture should always be done before the first dose of antibiotics. Other auxiliary investigations include a complete blood count, blood gases, urine culture, and a lumbar puncture. The threshold for performing a lumber puncture in all symptomatic newborns suspected of sepsis should be encouraged. It should however be deferred in neonates considered too unstable to tolerate the procedure, or where there is an absolute contraindication.\nSupportive treatment is essential for a good outcome in neonatal sepsis. Antibiotics are not the entire solution to their treatment. Nutrition or breastfeeding should be optimized. The environment should be thermo-neutral and oxygen saturation should be maintained within the normal range (89 – 95%). Intravenous fluids should be used if the infant is hemodynamically unstable. Monitoring of the blood glucose levels should be instituted. Packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma should be used in the event of anaemia or bleeding.",

Whereas the developed world describes kernicterus as a rare condition, unfortunately, the same cannot be said for us in developing countries. On average, cases of severe Neonatal Jaundice have ranged from 2.2% to 30.8% of all jaundice cases, with the monthly mortality ranging from 2.8% to 15.2%(REFERENCE).

For every gram of haemoglobin, 35mg of bilirubin is produced. The bilirubin is conjugated by the UGT enzyme, making it water-soluble, which is then released into the bile before being excreted in the stool (and urine). It can also be broken down in the intestine by bacterial enzymes like E. coli. However, at birth, the newborn has several challenges. The liver is immature, and the levels of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) enzyme are low. Newborns have β-glucuronidase in the intestinal mucosa/brush border, which deconjugates the conjugated bilirubin found in the meconium. The unconjugated bilirubin can now be reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and recycled back into the circulation. This process is known as the “enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin”. The gut is sterile and, subsequently, infants have far fewer bacteria in the gut, and so very little, if any, bilirubin is reduced to urobilin and stercobilin.\nSpecifically in newborns, more bilirubin is produced, on account of the short life span of Red Blood Cells and high Hemoglobin levels. The liver is immature. They also have fewer bacteria and low intestinal enzymatic activity in the intestine",

    "text": "10.4 Types of Jaundice\nThere are two main types of jaundice:\n\nPhysiological jaundice and\nPathological jaundice.\n\nThere are three main mechanisms for jaundice:\n\nIncreased bilirubin production\nDecreased bilirubin clearance and\nIncreased enterohepatic circulation.\n\n\n10.4.1 Physiological jaundice\n\n10.4.1.1 Increased bilirubin production\nin term newborn infants, bilirubin production is 2 to 3 times higher than in adults. This occurs because newborns have more RBCs and fetal RBCs have a shorter life span than those in adults. Unfortunately, the liver being immature, cannot conjugate and excrete all the bilirubin from the breakdown of all the excess RBCs, thereby resulting in spillover of bilirubin into the blood.\n\n\n10.4.1.2 Bilirubin clearance or excretion\nThis is decreased in newborns, mainly due to the low levels of the UGT enzyme in the liver. UGT activity in term infants at day 7 of age is approximately 1% of that of the adult liver and does not reach adult levels until about 14 weeks of age.\n\n\n10.4.1.3 Enterohepatic circulation\nThe presence of the ß-glucuronidase results in an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, further increasing the bilirubin load in the infant. This is a diagnosis of exclusion\n\n\n\n10.4.2 Pathological jaundice\n\n10.4.2.1 Definition\nNeonatal jaundice is said to be pathologic if:\n\nJaundice in the 1st 24 - 48 hours of life.\nRate of SB rise &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (8.5µmol/L) per hour\nJaundice all over the body (including palms & soles)\nPresence of a danger sign\nHistory of previous siblings having had jaundice at birth\nJaundice in a term newborn after 2 weeks of age or in a preterm infant after 3 weeks of age\nDirect (conjugated) bilirubin concentration &gt; 20% of the total\n\nIt can be caused by certain pathologic conditions or exaggeration of the mechanisms responsible for physiologic neonatal jaundice. Identification of what is causing the jaundice is useful in guiding management, including counselling of the parents and what to expect for the next pregnancy. Most common cause is increased bilirubin production due to haemolytic disease processes that include the following:\n\nIsoimmune-mediated haemolysis (e.g., ABO or Rhesus D incompatibility)\nErythrocyte enzymatic defects, e.g. G6PD deficiency\nSepsis, especially Urinary Tract Infection\nPolycythaemia\nBirth Injuries resulting in sequestration of blood within a closed space, e.g. cephalohematoma, subgaleal bleed.\n\n\n\n10.4.2.2 ABO incompatibility\nThis is one of the most common causes of isoimmune hemolytic disease during the neonatal period. Infants with blood group A or B, carried by blood group O mother, will have a positive antibody because of maternal anti-A or anti-B transfer into the fetal circulation.\n\n\n10.4.2.3 Rhesus Incompatibility\nRh incompatibility can occur when an Rh-negative pregnant mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells secondary to feto-maternal haemorrhage during pregnancy/delivery. As a result, the mother’s blood gets exposed to the fetal circulation and sensitization occurs leading to maternal antibody production against the foreign Rh antigen. Once produced, maternal Rh (IgG) antibodies may cross freely from the placenta to the fetal circulation, where they form antigen-antibody complexes with Rh- positive fetal RBCs and eventually are destroyed, resulting in a fetal alloimmune-induced hemolytic anaemia and jaundice. The first pregnancy is usually not affected, but more antibodies are produced with each pregnancy making the jaundice worse with each pregnancy.\n\n\n10.4.2.4 Decreased clearance\nInherited defects in the gene that encodes the UGT liver enzyme (eg, Gilbert Syndrome), decrease bilirubin conjugation (eg Crigglar Najjar). In physiological jaundice, the levels are naturally low, but here, in addition to the low levels the UGT enzyme is either defective, absent or has a reduced function. This reduces hepatic bilirubin metabolism and its clearance thereby increasing the total serum unconjugated bilirubin levels.\n\n\n10.4.2.5 Increased enterohepatic circulation\nThe major causes are\n\n\nBreastfeeding jaundice\nBreast milk jaundice\nImpaired intestinal motility is caused by functional or anatomic obstruction.\nCongenital hypothyroidism also causes increased enterohepatic circulation on account of reduced gut motility.",

The dose in turn is determined by:\n\nThe wavelength of the light\nThe intensity of the light (irradiance)\nThe distance between the light and the baby\nThe body’s surface area is exposed to the light.\n\nEffective phototherapy lowers serum bilirubin levels by converting the lipid-soluble bilirubin into water-soluble forms that can easily be excreted in the stool and urine Phototherapy also prevents the need for an Exchange Blood Transfusion and prevents bilirubin from depositing in the brain. The breakdown of bilirubin begins almost instantaneously when the skin is exposed to light, hence, phototherapy should be started as early as possible.\nIn initiating phototherapy, always note the time the baby’s SBR sample is being taken and estimate the age in hours up until that time. Interpret bilirubin levels according to the baby’s postnatal age in hours and manage the bilirubin levels according to the threshold table Start phototherapy if the SBR plots on or above the line appropriate for age (in hours) and gestational age If the SBR plots just underneath the line, repeat the SBR after 6 hours or start phototherapy if a repeat is not feasible. Repeat the SBR at least 24 to 48 hours after initiation of phototherapy. Discontinue phototherapy when the SBR plots below the line.\nThe side effects of phototherapy include:\n\nIncrease insensible water loss\nLoose stools\nSkin rash\nBronze baby syndrome\nHypo- or Hyperthermia\nInterruption of mother-baby bonding\n\n\n\n10.7.3 Sunlight Therapy\nWorks for physiological jaundice, however, one can never tell by looking at a baby what kind of jaundice a baby has Err on the side of caution, at least always have the SBR checked first Remember prolonged exposure to UV rays can be harmful to the developing skin Baby cannot be put in the light for more than 30 minutes in a day Even most of the available literature and studies that recommend sunlight still advice that if the jaundice is severe, the baby must be managed in the hospital!! A serum bilirubin high enough to warrant treatment should be managed in the hospital.\n\n\n10.7.4 Exchange Blood Transfusion\nProvides a means of rapid reduction of circulating bilirubin in the blood. Involves manual removal of the baby’s blood and simultaneously replacing it with compatible donor blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Exchange Blood Transfusion\n\n\n\nIn addition to reducing bilirubin levels, EBT removes partially hemolyzed RBCs, RBCs coated with antibodies and circulating immunoglobulins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Bilirubin Graph (&gt; 38 weeks)\n\n\n\nComplications of exchange blood transfusion include:\n\nCardiac & respiratory disorders\nShock due to bleeding or inadequate replacement of blood infection\nCatheter-related complications\nChanges in the composition of the blood (high or low potassium, low calcium, low glucose, changes in pH)\nThrombocytopenia\nAnd the rare but serious complications of air embolism, portal hypertension, and necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\n\n\n10.7.5 Intravenous Immunoglobins\nTreatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been suggested as an alternative therapy to Exchange Blood Transfusion for isoimmune hemolytic jaundice to reduce the need for Exchange Blood Transfusion and duration of phototherapy and hospitalization in isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn. It has been proposed that IVIG blocks the binding of the antibody to the antigen. With this blockade, hemolysis no longer occurs.",

    "text": "12.3 Epidemiology and Global Burden\nGlobally, about 15 million babies are born preterm every year — roughly 11% of all live births. Over 60% occur in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In Ghana, preterm delivery rates range from 10–15%, with low birth weight accounting for approximately 9–12% of births. Both conditions contribute significantly to neonatal deaths, particularly from respiratory distress, sepsis, and hypothermia.\nFactors such as inadequate antenatal care, infections, poor maternal nutrition, multiple pregnancies, and adolescent pregnancy increase the risk. Neonatal care resources — such as incubators, surfactant therapy, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — are often limited, worsening outcomes in resource-constrained settings.",

Disruption of any of these can impair fetal growth or lead to premature birth.\n\nPlacental development: The placenta serves as the interface for nutrient and oxygen exchange. Abnormal trophoblastic invasion or uteroplacental insufficiency can limit nutrient delivery, resulting in intrauterine growth restriction.\nLung development: The fetal lungs undergo several stages — embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar. Infants born before 34 weeks have surfactant deficiency, leading to respiratory distress.\nThermoregulation: Preterm infants have a large surface area-to-weight ratio, thin skin, and minimal subcutaneous fat, predisposing them to hypothermia.\nMetabolic adaptation: Immature hepatic enzymes, low glycogen stores, and poor feeding contribute to hypoglycaemia and metabolic instability.\nNeurological immaturity: Poor reflexes (suck, swallow, gag) and underdeveloped autonomic control affect feeding and cardiorespiratory stability.",

    "section": "13.8 Practical Challenges and Solutions",
    "text": "13.8 Practical Challenges and Solutions\n\n13.8.1 EARLY INITIATION OF BREASTFEEDING (EIB)\nEarly Initiation of Breastfeeding is essential, as it significantly decreases the risk of neonatal mortality. Unless there is a complication with the mother or the baby that prevents early initiation of breastfeeding (EIB), the baby should be delivered directly onto the mother’s abdomen and allowed to “crawl” to the breast and start suckling. This process is like a light switch that kicks start the process of establishing successful breastfeeding.\n\n\n13.8.2 Bottle Feeding\nHealth workers must be cautious about recommending feeding bottles, as mothers may not always be able to clean them due to inadequate water supplies and facilities for boiling and sterilizing. Feeding bottles and teats may also lead to nipple confusion, causing difficulties with latching.\n\n\n13.8.3 Prematurity\nFeeding methods vary (tube, cup, cup and spoon) based on gestational age and coordination of the suck-swallow reflex. Expressed breast milk is the food of choice for every preterm baby, unless there is a genuine contraindication, such as an inborn error of metabolism, in which case breastmilk is contraindicated.\n\n\n13.8.4 Mouth Abnormalities\nMouth conditions, such as cleft lip and/or palate, or severe oral thrush, may necessitate expressed milk and alternative feeding methods.\n\n\n13.8.5 Multiple Births\nFrequent feeding stimulates supply. Twins and triplets can be exclusively breastfed with proper support for the mother. Higher multiples should also start with exclusive breastfeeding, but are likely to outgrow a mother’s milk supply rapidly and require supplementation. Support for the mother, making sure she is relieved of as many other chores as possible, is key to successful breastfeeding in multiple pregnancies.\n\n\n13.8.6 Perceived or Real Milk Insufficiency\nIt is common for mothers, especially first-time mothers, to lack confidence in their ability to breastfeed and to feel they do not have enough breast milk. Once the baby is gaining weight and is generally well, support and counseling are essential and are often all that is needed. True breastmilk insufficiency is rare but distressing when it occurs. Good expression techniques can help maintain a sufficient milk supply.\n\n\n13.8.7 Maternal Illness\nMost conditions, including maternal tuberculosis and HIV (with precautions), are not necessarily contraindications to breastfeeding. Support and education are critical. When a mother is ill, it is important not to assume that she cannot breastfeed, but rather to objectively assess the risk to the baby as against the many benefits the baby will receive from breastfeeding. National guidelines, where available, should be consulted, and each mother and baby dyad assessed carefully. The decision not to breastfeed should never be made lightly, as even where the family can afford and correctly prepare infant formula, the risk of illnesses such as asthma and allergies may be increased. Where the ability to sustain adequate formula feeding is a challenge to the family, the effect on the child’s health can be disastrous.\n\n\n13.8.8 Mothers in Formal Employment\nSupportive workplaces (Baby Friendly Workplaces), extended paid maternity leave, effective use of hand expression, and good-quality breast pumps are some of the ways to help mothers who work outside the home to continue breastfeeding. Breast pump technology has evolved over the years so that there are, for example, wearable hands-free breast pumps which can discreetly pump breast milk whilst the mother is at work. However simple, correctly done hand expression of breast milk is very effective. Breast milk can then be stored at room temperature for 6 hours, in a good fridge with a temperature of 6-7oC for 24 hours, and in a deep freezer or fridge freezer at a temperature of -17oC and below for 6 months. The milk can then be fed to the baby by cup by whoever is caring for the child.",

Causes include severe airway obstruction (status asthmaticus), respiratory muscle fatigue, central depression of respiration, and neuromuscular disease.\nMixed respiratory failure combines both elements and is common in advanced respiratory disease or severe sepsis.\n\nUnderstanding the difference is practical: hypoxaemia requires restoration of oxygenation (oxygen and recruitment of alveoli), while hypercapnia indicates a need to improve ventilation (support minute ventilation).",

Disruption to any of these leads to failure.\nIn ventilatory failure, the work of breathing exceeds the capacity of respiratory muscles; progressive fatigue causes hypoventilation and CO₂ retention. Children with severe asthma, upper airway obstruction, or neuromuscular weakness may decompensate rapidly.\nIn oxygenation failure, processes such as alveolar consolidation (pneumonia), surfactant deficiency (preterm infants), pulmonary oedema, or widespread inflammation (ARDS) reduce the effective surface area for oxygen diffusion. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch and intrapulmonary shunting contribute to refractory hypoxaemia.\nNeonates and infants are particularly vulnerable because of small functional residual capacity, high oxygen consumption, and immature control of breathing — they desaturate quickly once compromise begins.",

Interventions should be guided by severity and available resources.\n\n15.7.1 Immediate actions\nApply the ABC approach. Ensure airway patency, give supplemental oxygen early, and support ventilation if there are signs of respiratory compromise. Keep the child warm, monitor glucose, and establish IV access (or IO in emergencies). Treat reversible causes such as severe asthma with bronchodilators and steroids, or sepsis with timely antibiotics.\n\n\n15.7.2 Oxygen therapy\nOxygen is the cornerstone for hypoxaemic children. Start with low-flow oxygen via nasal prongs or face mask, titrating to target SpO₂ levels appropriate for age (generally ≥92% in older children; lower targets may apply for certain neonates/conditions). Where available, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or CPAP provides effective respiratory support in moderate distress, reducing the need for intubation in many cases.\n\n\n15.7.3 Non-invasive and invasive ventilation\nWhen oxygen alone is insufficient (persistent hypoxaemia on high FiO₂, rising PaCO₂, or respiratory fatigue), provide ventilatory support. Non-invasive options such as CPAP and BiPAP are useful for selected patients. Intubation and mechanical ventilation become necessary for respiratory arrest, severe hypercapnia, or inability to protect the airway. Mechanical ventilation requires skilled staff and monitoring to avoid complications such as barotrauma and ventilator-associated pneumonia.\n\n\n15.7.4 Specific therapies\nTreat the underlying pathology: antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia, bronchodilators and systemic steroids for asthma, surfactant for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (where indicated), diuretics for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, and bronchoscopy for airway foreign bodies.\n\n\n15.7.5 Supportive care\nAdequate hydration, nutritional support, correction of anaemia, and seizure control (if present) are vital. Prevent and manage complications like pneumothorax promptly. Keep meticulous infection control practices and consider early transfer to higher-level care when advanced ventilation or paediatric intensive care is needed.",

Familiarity with the physiological differences of children, common causes in the local context, and a stepwise approach to oxygenation and ventilation are essential competencies for medical students and clinicians. While advanced therapies exist, many deaths from respiratory failure are preventable with timely basic interventions, improved public health measures, and strengthened paediatric acute care capacity across Ghana.",

It is one of the most common chronic diseases in children worldwide, including in Ghana. Effective management is essential in pediatric care, especially due to its impact on the quality of life, school attendance, and healthcare utilization.\nUnderstanding asthma in children is crucial for early diagnosis, effective management, and the prevention of complications. This note outlines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, differential diagnoses, management, and public health implications of childhood asthma, with a focus on the context of Ghanaian healthcare.",

Pneumonia develops when these defenses are breached — by overwhelming microbial inoculation, impaired clearance, or immune compromise.\nMicroorganisms reach the alveoli by inhalation, aspiration, or via the bloodstream. The host immune response leads to inflammation, exudation of fluid and cells into the alveolar spaces, and impaired gas exchange.\nTypical bacterial pneumonia leads to alveolar consolidation — a process in which alveoli are filled with exudate containing neutrophils and fibrin. This impedes oxygen diffusion and causes hypoxaemia.\nViral pneumonia, in contrast, causes interstitial inflammation, airway oedema, and epithelial necrosis, predisposing to secondary bacterial infection.\nThe degree of impairment depends on the virulence of the organism and host factors such as nutritional status, immunization history, and presence of comorbidities.",

Injury from mechanical ventilation and reactive oxygen species to the premature lungs in the presence of antenatal factors predisposing the lung to BPD forms the basis of the pathogenesis in preterm infants. This leads to an inflammatory response with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 IL-8, and TNF alpha, along with growth factors (Transforming growth factors,), angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factors, angiopoietin 2), which result in aberrant tissue repair and arrest in lung development. Dysregulated vascular and arrested alveolar development form the basis of the pathology seen in the new BPD. Histologically, BPD occurs when lung development arrests in the late canaliculi to the saccular stage of lung development. The pathology characteristically demonstrates decreased septation and alveoli hypoplasia resulting in simplified large alveoli and reduced availability for gaseous exchange.",

The ductus venosus regresses quickly to form the ligamentum arteriosus. The foramen ovale closes at birth physiologically but may take years to close anatomically. The patent ductus arteriosus closes soon after birth but can physiologically stay open for 72 hours. Beyond this period it is considered to be pathologic if it continues to stay open.

They include Infective Endocarditis (IE), Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and Endomyocardial Fibrosis (EMF)\nRhythm disorders: This set of disorders can present as either congenital or acquired. They affect the electrical system of the heart leading to an increase in heart rate (tachyarrhythmia), decrease in heart rate (bradyarrhythmia) or even normal heart rate.\nSecondary cardiac disorders: Some pathologies tend to affect the heart as a complication.

    "text": "22.1.1 Prenatal\nPrenatally, the history should delve into but not be limited to the following:\n\nInfections: Some infections are the well-known TORCHES. They include Toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, parvovirus B19 (fifth disease), varicella (chickenpox) and (Zika), Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus. Rubella, when acquired in the first trimester of pregnancy, is very well known to be associated with PDAs.\nMedications: The use of some medications, including herbs, predisposes to heart disease in newborns. Anticonvulsant such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are highly teratogenic.(Kalisch-Smith, Ved, and Sparrow 2019)\nRecreational drugs: Excessive smoking, cocaine, and alcohol use in early pregnancy are all associated with teratogenic effects on the heart.\nMaternal illnesses: Maternal medical conditions during pregnancy may be associated with heart diseases in their fetuses. Diabetes mellitus is particularly well known, predisposing to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, d-Transposition of the Great Arteries, etc. Autoimmune conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus may also predispose to rhythm disturbances in the fetus and child, even when the mother is not symptomatic.\nFamily history of CHD: The recurrence of CHD in first-degree relatives varies but is almost always higher than in the rest of the population. For instance, having a first-degree relation with a cornoventricular defect is associated with a recurrence risk ratio of 24.3 (95% CI,12.2 to 48.7), 7.1 (95% CI, 4.5 to 11.1) for isolated Atrial Septal Defect, and 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.3) for isolated Ventricular Septal Defect.(Øyen et al. 2009)\n\n\n\n22.1.2 Perinatal\nPerinatal history associated with heart disease may include the following:\n\nBirth weight: A high birth weight, often associated with a child of a diabetic mother, is also associated with an increased incidence of CHDs. Conversely, a low birth weight may also be associated with fetal alcohol syndrome or congenital rubella syndrome, both of which are associated with CHDs.\nNewborn resuscitation: Some critical CHDs can be similar to neonatal asphyxia in a newborn, thus requiring resuscitation.\n\n\n\n22.1.3 After birth\nAscertaining history after birth is the most extensive. Many of these are directed to the features of heart failure. These include:\n\nGrowth failure: Poor weight gain is a very prominent feature of CHDs in children. Many clinically significant CHDs result in poor feeding, chronic metabolic demand on the patient and poor oxygenation in cyanotic CHDs. All these result in increased caloric demand, resulting in poor growth.\nCyanotic spells: Some cyanotic CHDs are associated with recurrent periods where the child has increasing cyanosis, sometimes associated with weakness, fast breathing and even unconsciousness. The presence of these spells may be a pointer to a CHD.\nSquatting and exercise intolerance: Exercise intolerance is a common presentation of heart disease in children. However, for some cyanotic congenital heart diseases, most notably Tetralogy of Fallot, the added feature is frequent squatting when the child becomes fatigued.\nDelayed milestones: Growth failure, easy fatiguability, and other genetic syndromes may delay motor milestones in children.\nOthers: Fast and sometimes difficult breathing are also common presentations of CHDs. Some children develop oedema.(Figure 22.1) This is predominantly seen in younger children’s faces and older children’s feet. Frequent lower respiratory infection is also seen in children with heart diseases, especially those associated with heart failure.\nUncommon symptoms: Uncommon presentation of heart disease in children include:\n\nChest pain is a rather feared symptom in adults but usually portends another diagnosis rather than heart disease in children.\nSyncope can be observed in children with an arrhythmia or left or right ventricular obstruction. However, this is still not a common presentation in pediatric heart diseases.\nOlder children report palpitations.\nJoint swelling does occur in Rheumatic Heart Disease, but again, it is not a common presentation in children with heart pathology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.1: Pedal oedema in a child with heart failure",

Bicuspid Aortic Valve, Aortic Stenosis, Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n\n\nDiGeorge syndrome\n70 to 75\nAortic arch anomalies, Truncus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n\nWilliam’s syndrome\n75 to 80\nSupravalvar Aortic Stenosis, Peripheral Pulmonary Stenosis\n\n\nNoonan syndrome\n70 to 80\nPulmonary Stenosis, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Atrial Septal Defect\n\n\nKabuki syndrome\n31 to 55\nCoarctation of the Aorta, Atrial Septal Defect, Aortic Stenosis, Mitral Stenosis, Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n\n\nAlagille syndrome\n90\nPeripheral Pulmonary Stenosis, Pulmonary Stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour: The skin colour of a child with a CHD could hold signs of its presence. Cyanosis, the blueish duskiness of the skin and mucous membranes can be seen in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease. This may not be easy on black skin and can only be observed in the mouth and tongue (Figure 22.2). Mild cyanosis is often not visible and may require pulse oximetry. Pallor can be observed in patients with heart diseases, such as Infective Endocarditis. Jaundice can be observed in patients with Infective Endocarditis or those with hepatic injury secondary to chronic heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.2: Cyanosis in the tongue of a child\n\n\n\n\nClubbing: All four stages of digital clubbing are seen in children with cyanotic CHD or Infective Endocarditis. (Figure 22.3) Note that some cases of finger clubbing may be familial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.3: Finger clubbing\n\n\n\n\nRespiratory signs: Respiratory signs commonly associated with heart diseases in children are tachypnoea, dyspnoea, chest recessions, and increased work of breathing. These are especially true when there is associated heart failure, which worsens with exercise or breastfeeding infants.\nCirculation: The circulation in a child with a suspected heart disease is critical. Reduced circulation can be assessed with the warmth of the extremities, capillary refill time, and blood pressure.\nBlood pressure: Low blood pressure is a late sign of circulatory failure and cardiogenic shock. Conversely, weak pulse may be associated with hypertensive heart disease as well. Wide pulse pressure, an abnormally wide difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, may indicate a patent ductus arteriosus, aortic insufficiency or an aorticopulmonary window. Blood pressure should be checked in the upper and lower limbs as a higher BP in the upper limbs compared to the lower may indicate the presence of a Coarctation of the Aorta.\nPulses: The radial pulse is the most routinely examined in cardiovascular examination. It should be checked for the rate, rhythm, volume and character. If they are difficult to examine, especially in young infants, the brachial pulsus can be used. Other pulses should be examined, including the brachial femoral and dorsalis pedis. Next, the synchronisation of the radio-femoral pulse should be determined for a delay. This happens in the coarctation of the aorta. Pulses that are challenging to palpate or inconsistent could be caused by large artery arteritis, such as Taksyasu’s arteritis.\n\n\n\n22.2.2 Precordial\n\nInspection: Inspection of the precordium yields a wealth of information in a child with a suspected heart disease. A midline bulge or left-sided bulge will often indicate a right or left-sided heart chamber dilatation. Visible precordial pulsation should be noted. Scars, especially from previous surgeries, are useful. Scarification, the usually small “medicinal” scars done on the chest as a means of treatment, should also be noted. A Harrison sulcus, depression of the lower part of the chest, is common in children with chronic heart failure and, thus, dyspnoea. Figure 22.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.4: Chest bulge and Harrison’s sulcus in child\n\n\n\n\nPalpation: Palpation should be directed toward determining the presence of a thrill (a palpable murmur) heave at the apex or middle of the precordium. Also, a palpable heart sound, especially the second at the upper left sternal edge, may indicate pulmonary hypertension.\nPercussion: This is of very little relevance in examining the heart in children.\nAuscultation: Auscultation of the heart can yield a wealth of information. It should be done in a quiet environment, with the child as calm as possible. Auscultating can be performed with both bell and diaphragm. All four auscultatory areas need to be auscultated. Auscultating the back (between the scapulae) and over the carotids is always prudent. First, the regular two heart sounds should be determined. If muffled, they could indicate a pericardial effusion or sometimes obesity. Pulmonary hypertension and an Atrial Septal Defect, for instance could result in a loud or split-second heart sound. The presence of a third heart sound (S3) is not always pathologic in children, but an S4 is. The presence of a murmur needs to be determined. If present, it should be determined if it is systolic or diastolic and the point of maximal intensity. It needs to be graded (Table 22.2), and the presence of radiation must be ascertained. Table 22.3 indicates types of murmurs, their location and likely heart diseases. Diastolic murmurs are difficult to appreciate for the average medical student but may be present in aortic regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation, and at the cardiac apex in cases of heart failure secondary to a large left-to-right shunt. Notably, approximately 80% of murmurs in children can be categorised as “innocent murmurs” as they are not associated with cardiac pathology.\nOther sounds need to be evaluated as well. These may include a pericardial rub, which occurs in pericarditis, an ejection click heart in early systole and cases of aortic or pulmonary stenosis.\n\n\n\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.5.1\n\n\n\n\nTable 22.2: Grades of murmurs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGrade I\nBarely perceptible\n\n\nGrade II\nSoft, but easily audible\n\n\nGrade III\nModerately loud but has not thrill\n\n\nGrade IV\nLoud and associated with a thrill\n\n\nGrade V\nAudible with stethoscope partially of the chest\n\n\nGrade VI\nAudible with stethoscope off the chest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 22.3: Heart diseases and their murmur characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurmur\nLocation\nCondition\n\n\n\n\nPansystolic\nLLSB\nVSD, Tricuspid regurgitation\n\n\nPansystolic\nApex\nRheumatic Heart Disease, Mitral valve prolapse\n\n\nEjection systolic\nURSB\nAortic stenosis\n\n\nEjection systolic\nULSB\nASD, Pulmonary stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot, Coarctation of the aorta\n\n\nContinuous\n2nd left ICS\nPatent Dutus Arteriosus",

    "section": "22.3 Investigation",
    "text": "22.3 Investigation\nVarious investigations used in the diagnosis and management of heart diseases are:\n\nPulse Oximetry: Pulse oximetry helps determine heart rate and oxygen saturation. An oxygen saturation lower than expected (&lt;95% outside the early neonatal period) is considered abnormal and a strong indication of cyanotic heart disease in the presence of a non-pathologic lung.\nElectrocardiogram: The electrocardiogram is a common modality for the bedside investigation of heart diseases in all age groups. It indicates the heart rate, rhythm, chamber dilatation, wall thickness, laterality of the chambers, electrolyte abnormalities and even the presence of a head injury. It is often not conclusive in many heart conditions but serves as a good auxiliary test in children, especially post-surgery. There are various types: The routine ECG takes just a few minutes to perform on a resting patient, usually lying supine. On the other hand, the stress ECG is traditionally done with the heart under stress, as may happen during an aerobic exercise. The Holter ECG, on the other hand, is attached to the patient and continuously monitors the heart for 24 to 48 hours. This usually gives a better reflection of the heart’s electrical activity over a prolonged period instead of just a brief period.\nX-ray: A chest x-ray is very useful in diagnosing and managing heart diseases in children. Fortunately, it is readily available in many parts of Ghana. Both posteroanterior and lateral chest X-rays can be useful in assessing the individual chamber and overall heart sizes. Cardiomegaly, assessed with a cardiothoracic ratio &gt; 60% in children, is seen in many cases of heart disease. Chest X-rays also indicate ling pathologies, often showing as opacification or silhouetting. Increased lung markings, for instance, can be found in patients with VSD and ASD, while decreased lung markings are often seen in the Tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis. The shape of the heart is often an indicator of the underlying cardiac pathology. A Boot-shaped heart may indicate a Tetraloy of Fallot (Figure 22.7), while a globular-shaped heart points to dilated cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Figure 22.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.5: Chest x-ray showing cardiomegaly and lung shadowing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.6: Chest x-ray showing a globular heart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.7: Boot-shaped heart of Chest X-X-ray\n\n\n\n\nEchocardiogram: This is a rather old but new investigatory modality. It is old because it has been around since the 1960s and new because it is relatively new in Ghana. It is, however, a beneficial modality of investigation. An echocardiogram is essentially an ultrasound of the heart and great vessels. Its most significant advantage is its ability to visualise the heart in real-time, assess systolic and diastolic functions, measure chamber sizes and wall thickness, detect defects such as ventricular septal defect, determine valvular abnormalities such as stenosis and regurgitation, and even assess all these under stressful situation (stress echocardiogram). The video below illustrates the various echocardiographic views used in children. Unfortunately, since it is very user-dependent, it is not commonly available in Ghana, with pediatric echocardiography only currently available in Accra, Kumasi, Cape Coast and Tamale.\n\nComputerised tomography (CT) scan and Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI): These are more advanced modalities available for use, especially when an echocardiogram is inconclusive or further study of the patient is necessary. A CT scan generates the image using a series of X-rays taken at different angles without the complication of significant X-ray radiation exposure. Both modalities can employ contrast to delineate vessels.\nOthers: Other specialised investigatory modalities are used as required, including cardiac catheterisation in a specialised catheter laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\nKalisch-Smith, Jacinta Isabelle, Nikita Ved, and Duncan Burnaby Sparrow. 2019. “Environmental Risk Factors for Congenital Heart Disease.” Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology 12 (3): a037234. https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a037234.\n\n\nKo, Jung Min. 2015. “Genetic Syndromes Associated with Congenital Heart Disease.” Korean Circulation Journal 45 (5): 357. https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2015.45.5.357.\n\n\nØyen, Nina, Gry Poulsen, Heather A.

There are three main groups of causes:\n\nVentricular dysfunction results from either systolic or diastolic dysfunction of the ventricles. Systolic dysfunction is more commonly encountered compared to diastolic ones. Examples are:\n\nCardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive and hypertrophic)\nMyocarditis\nArrhythmias\nCoronary artery anomalies\nPost-op cardiac dysfunction\n\nVolume overload occurs in conditions associated with increased volume (preload) in the heart, especially the ventricles. The ventricle must, therefore, eject an increased blood volume, leading to tachycardia. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. Examples include:\n\nVentricular septal defect (left to right shunt)\nAtrial septal defect\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nAortic regurgitation (left ventricle)\nMitral regurgitation (Left atrium)\n\nPressure overload is when heart failure is caused by an increased pressure (afterload) in the heart. Ventricles must, therefore, contract against higher pressures. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. These include:\n\nHypertension\nAortic valve stenosis\nPulmonary stenosis\nCoarctation of the aorta\n\n\nIn all these, the result is decreased cardiac output and pulmonary oedema.",

Others include cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, Ventricular Assisted Devices and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation. Heart transplantation is the last option in some cases of heart failure.\n\n\n23.7.2 Pharmacological treatment\nTreatment depends on the clinical presentation and cause of the heart failure. There are 2 main groups to be considered:\n\n\n23.7.3 Acute decompensated heart failure\n\n\n\nTable 23.3: Drugs used in acute decompensated heart failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\nAction\n\n\n\n\nDiuretics\nNotable here is furosemide.

They decrease afterload while helping in reversing cardiac remodelling.\n\n\nACE-I/ARB\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers counteract the renin effects of increasing afterload. They thus decrease the afterload and help reverse and prevent cardiac remodelling\n\n\nDigoxin\nThis is probably the oldest anti-heart failure medication.

Thus an uncomplicated ASD is acyanotic. The shunting also leads to volume overload of the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery and lungs. This consequently results in dilatation of the right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery, and pulmonary oedema. The low pressure in the atria implies low pressure in the right ventricle, pulmonary artery and lungs. This reduces the extent of pulmonary oedema and, subsequently, overt heart failure in a child with ASD, compared to other congenital heart defects such as ventricular septal defects. However, longstanding long-standing lesions or relatively large ones, especially those with a pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio of 2 or more, could lead to heart failure and pulmonary hypertension after about 15 to 20 years with subsequent reversal of the shunt.",

However, those with relatively large defects with a high Qp:Qs may result in heart failure. Therefore, many of these patients have been diagnosed incidentally when they, for instance, report to the health institution for another complaint. They tend to have slender bodies and reduced exercise tolerance.\nAuscultation usually reveals a widely fixed-split second heart sound and an ejection systolic murmur of grade 2/3 to 3/6, loudest at the left upper sternal border. Unfortunately, many ASDs are silent as well. These properties lead to many undiagnosed ASD that are subsequently seen in adulthood.",

Thus, a VSD is usually an acyanotic congenital heart lesion. This leads to a volume overload of the pulmonary artery, lungs, left atrium and left ventricle. These chambers subsequently dilated. Pulmonary edema develops from lung congestion leading to signs of heart failure.\nSecondly, depending on the size of the defect the pressure in the left ventricle will get transmitted to the right. How much pressure is transmitted depends on the size of the defect with bigger defects transmitting more than smaller ones. This can result in increased right ventricular pressure, and hypertrophy. It also worsens the pulmonary oedema already mentioned above.\nPersistent pressure and volume overload cause remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in permanent changes and pulmonary hypertension. When the pulmonary pressure rises significantly higher than the systemic pressure, a reversal of the shunt results, leading to decreased oxygen saturation.",

Larger ones result in relatively higher pressure and volume. Small VSDs are usually asymptomatic with no volume or pressure overload of the lung, pulmonary artery and right heart. Some volume and pressure overload usually accompanies moderate-sized VSDs. They are thus often accompanied by some heart failure and recurrent lower respiratory infections. Large defects are accompanied by severe volume and pressure overload. They present with persistent heart failure and failure to thrive, exercise intolerance. When longstanding, they often end up with significant pulmonary hypertension.\nNewborns with VSD may not have a murmur at birth. This is due to relatively high pulmonary pressure in the first weeks of life. The intensity of the murmur may increase as the pulmonary pressure decreases, usually over 4 weeks. The patient then becomes more symptomatic with a louder pansystolic murmur loudest at the lower left sternal border. Patients with a large defect may present with an apical diastolic rumble. Cyanosis may present in a long-standing large VSD with pulmonary hypertension.",

At birth, the rise in PaO2 and decline in prostaglandin concentration cause closure of the ductus arteriosus, typically beginning within the first 10 to 15 hours of life. If this normal process does not occur, the ductus arteriosus will remain patent. The PDA then results in excess blood shunting from the aorta, across the duct and into the pulmonary artery. This shunting causes volume overload. There is therefore a circuit of excess blood volume in the pulmonary arteries, lungs, left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta. This subsequently leads to dilatation of the left pulmonary artery, left atrium and left ventricle as well as pulmonary edema and heart failure.",

This condition accounts for approximately 5-8% of all congenital heart defects in children and is more prevalent in males than females. CoA can present with varying degrees of severity and may occur as an isolated defect or associated with other cardiac anomalies, such as bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defect (VSD), or complex syndromes like Turner syndrome.",

    "text": "27.2 Anatomy and Pathophysiology\nThe aorta plays a crucial role in distributing oxygenated blood from the heart’s left ventricle to the systemic circulation. In CoA, the narrowing typically occurs at the isthmus of the aorta, which is located distal to the left subclavian artery and near the ductus arteriosus, a fetal blood vessel that normally closes after birth. The severity of CoA depends on the degree of narrowing, which can obstruct blood flow and increase the heart’s afterload.\nThe left ventricle must work harder in children to pump blood through the narrowed segment, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy. Prolonged obstruction may result in high blood pressure (hypertension) in the upper body and diminished blood flow to the lower body. Collateral circulation often develops as the body compensates using smaller vessels to bypass the narrowing, but this is not always sufficient to normalize blood flow.",

    "text": "28.4 Pathophysiology\n\nThe severity of clinical signs and symptoms depends on the proportion of the cardiac output going through the pulmonary artery, the relative pressures in the right and left ventricles, and the proportion of the aorta overriding the VSD.\nThe VSD is normally of a significant size, which causes the systolic pressures between the ventricles to equalize. In mild ToF, the left ventricular pressures remain higher than the right ventricle, thus, blood shunts from left to right through the VSD. These patients are normally acyanotic. In more severe diseases, due to increased right ventricular pressure (secondary to Pulmonary Stenosis), the shunt direction reverses from right to left, allowing the mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood. This results in lower oxygenated blood in the systemic circulation, making patients cyanotic.\nPulmonary stenosis can be classified according to its location. The commonest site is the infundibular septum (50%). The stenosis may also be valvular (10%) or a combination (30%). This results in impaired flow of deoxygenated blood into the main pulmonary artery. It may be severe enough to cause intermittent right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This forms the basis of hypercyanotic episodes (tet spells).\nHypertrophy of the right ventricle occurs in response to the high pressures it must overcome to force deoxygenated blood through the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Compared to the normal heart, the aorta in ToF is dilated and displaced over the interventricular septum. Aortic dilatation is caused by an increase in blood flow through the aorta as it receives blood from both ventricles via the Ventricular Septal Defect.",

It presents most commonly in children less than 2 years old.\n\n28.13.1 Presentation\nChildren with hypercyanotic spells present with paroxysms of increased and deep breathing, irritability, prolonged, unsettled crying, increasing cyanosis, seizures, and decreased intensity of the heart murmur. In untreated cases, this might lead to brain damage or death.\n\n\n28.13.2 Pathophysiology\nA hypercyanitic spell can have many precipitating factors. These may include fever, anemia, dehydration, prolonged crying, and eating. These precipitants lead to decreased lung blood flow and progressively increase right-to-left shunting. This leads to increasing cyanosis, tachycardia, and reduced systemic vascular resistance. Carbon dioxide accumulation stimulates the central respiratory center, leading to increased and deep breathing. All these unfortunately cause further right-to-left shunting, thus perpetuating the hypoxia.\n\n\n28.13.3 Treatment\nThe treatment goal is to increase preload and promote pulmonary blood flow.\n\nFirst, the child should be placed in a knee-chest position. This increases systemic vascular resistance, temporarily raises the systemic pressure, and reduces the right-to-left shunting.\nOxygen can be administered, though it is of limited value and should not be forced on the patient if he is combative.\nNext volume expansion with intravenous fluids should be administered. This raises the preload and increases systemic pressure, thus reducing right-to-left shunting.\nIntramuscular or subcutaneous morphine can be administered.

It is characterized by permanent damage to the heart valves, particularly the mitral and aortic valves, due to repeated episodes of inflammation and scarring. RHD remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among children and young adults in low- and middle-income countries. Early diagnosis and management of ARF and RHD are critical to prevent severe complications and improve outcomes.",

The following factors contribute to its development:\n\nInfectious Agent: GAS infection, particularly of the throat, is necessary to initiate the autoimmune process. Certain GAS strains (M-protein serotypes) are more rheumatogenic.\nHost Susceptibility: Genetic predisposition plays a role, with family clustering observed in affected individuals.\nEnvironmental Factors: Overcrowding, poor hygiene, and limited access to healthcare increase the risk of GAS infections and progression to ARF and RHD.\n\nRHD develops through the following sequence:\n\nGAS Pharyngitis: GAS infection elicits an immune response involving antibodies and T-cells targeting streptococcal antigens.\nMolecular Mimicry: Cross-reactivity occurs between streptococcal antigens (e.g., M protein) and human proteins in the heart, joints, brain, and skin. Autoimmune inflammation leads to tissue damage.\nAcute Rheumatic Fever: Pancarditis (endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis) is the hallmark of ARF. The endocardium is most affected, leading to valvulitis.\nChronic RHD: Recurrent inflammation and scarring cause permanent valvular damage, predominantly affecting the mitral and aortic valves. Mitral stenosis is the most common lesion, followed by mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation.",

The risk of environmental transmission of typhoid fever is higher in the rainy season, proximity to open sewers and highly contaminated water bodies and residing in areas of low elevation.(Adesegun et al. 2020) Ingested organisms survive exposure to gastric acid before gaining access to the small bowel, where they penetrate the epithelium, enter the lymphoid tissue, and disseminate via the lymphatic or hematogenous route.

Where there is poor response attributed to a focus e.g. abscess formation, source control should be pursued.

Typhoid is spread via the faecal-oral route when bacteria pass into people’s mouths through food, water, hands, or objects contaminated with faecal matter. Solutions such as water treatment or filtration, installation and management of toilets and sanitation systems, and education about proper handwashing and food-handling practices can save lives and protect people from typhoid infection.

Ghanaians co-infected with HIV 1 and HIV 2 form 0.02% of total infections. HIV-2 is mainly concentrated in West Africa and the surrounding countries. HIV-2 is less fatal and progresses more slowly than HIV-1. Modes of HIV transmission are sexual (80% in Ghana) mainly heterosexual but also same-sex; parenteral transmission (5%) examples include blood transmission, shared needles, and needle stick accidents, and mother-to-child transmission (15%) of which in-utero, intrapartum and postpartum accounts for 10-25%, 60-75%, and 10-20% respectively.",

The intricate series of protein-protein interactions that ultimately result in virus infection can be divided into several phases, some of which are essential and others that may modulate the efficiency of the process.(Wilen, Tilton, and Doms 2012)\nInfection with HIV starts without symptoms or ill-feeling and is accompanied by slight changes in the immune system. This stage spans up to three months after infection until seroconversion where HIV-specific antibodies can be detected in individuals following recent exposure. The outcome of infection and duration of disease progression with clinical symptoms may vary greatly between individuals, but often it progresses fairly slowly. It takes several years from primary infection to the development of symptoms of advanced HIV diseases and immunosuppression.(Cunningham et al. 2000) Although individuals may look healthy during primary infection, the virus replicates in infected individuals’ lymph nodes and bloodstream. As a result, the immune system may get slowly damaged by the burst of viral load in their bodies.(Moir, Chun, and Fauci 2011)",

These babies should be given antiretroviral prophylaxis namely nevirapine and zidovudine daily starting from birth (within 24 hours) for 3 months. At week 6, infants should be started on cotrimoxazole daily till HIV infection is ruled out at 18 months. At any point in time when a child tests positive for HIV, treatment with cotrimoxazole should be continued for a longer duration till the child’s immune system is fully re-constituted and appropriate for age. The best marker is appropriate CD4 for age. In the absence of CD4 testing, the child should be virologically suppressed with no evidence of clinical disease.@borges-lujan2022\n\n\n34.7.2 Treatment of HIV infection\nCounselling caregivers and children is a must before initiating HAART.

    "text": "34.13 Answers to sample questions\n\nIt is important to know the duration of the other symptoms if they are beyond 3 months. Ask about interventions, facilities visited and what was done for the patient. The top three possibilities are HIV/AIDS, Malignancy and tuberculosis. Malignancy should be ruled out (REFER TO ONCOLOGY LECTURES). Tuberculosis is confirmed in this child. Since HIV is a risk factor for developing TB, it is right to think of HIV in this child. Remember HIV is a family disease. Parents and other siblings MUST also be screened if they exist.\nTo diagnose HIV test, this child must have positive tests on all tests using the “triple algorithm” namely first response, Oraquick, and SD bioline.\nThis child has confirmed Pulmonary TB. PTB is airborne and therefore there is the need to screen close contacts. This will help identify the index case and put in necessary screening tests. Those who have the disease are treated while those exposed without the disease will need TB preventive therapy.\nThis child’s HIV test was positive. He has both pulmonary TB and TB meningitis. Referring to the notes on WHO clinical staging, PTB is stage 3 while TB Meningitis (TBM) is stage 4. This child therefore has clinical stage 4\nRemember that this child has an opportunist infection (TB). To prevent Immune Reconstitutive Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), this child has to start TB treatment before starting HAART, for PTB HAART is started preferably 2 weeks after TB medication. For TBM, HAART should be started 4-6 weeks after initiating TB medications.\nNote: Drug-drug interaction occurs between some ARVs and rifampicin. Dolutegravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and nevirapine should be doubled when administered simultaneously with rifampicin. When TB treatment ends, extend the duration of the double dose of the ARVs for 2 weeks before reducing the dose to the expected age and weight of the children.\nIn deciding on the best HAART, an ARV should each be selected from groups 1,2 and 3. From group 1, the only feasible option is abacavir because HB is &lt; 8g/dl and weight is &lt; 30 kg(AZT and TCF cannot be used). Under group 2, either 3TC or FTC are possible but 3TC is readily available. Under group 3, DTG will be the best option because EFV has a lower resistance barrier and high community resistance. LPV/r is plausible but twice daily regimen makes compliance more difficult. The best option will be ABC/3TC/DTG (option b is the best choice)\nBeing a drug addict, he may be using intravenous injection which increases his risk of being infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Again, he may be having sexual partners exposing him to STI. He, therefore, has to be investigated for hepatitis B/C, full blood count, and screened for other STIs. The choice of HAART will have to factor in hepatitis B status. TDF can be given because he weighs more than 30 kg and renal function is normal. Based on the previous explanation, TDF/3TC/DTG is the best choice. This option comes as a Fixed dose combination so he will take just 1 tablet daily, improving compliance among adolescents. Should the adolescent be Hepatitis B positive, TDF/3TC are also active against hepatitis B. Adolescents should be referred for appropriate services if there are other co-morbidities. Referral to a clinical psychologist will also be needed because he is addicted to drugs\nAntibodies are IgG and cross the placental to the baby. Newborns testing positive using antibody tests might be maternally transmitted. Antibody tests do not confirm HIV in children below 18 months. These antibodies are expected to disappear by 18 months. The recommended test for a 6-month-old baby is a DNA PCR test (refer to above). Other tests and timelines if the baby is negative at 6 months, are at 9 months (DNA PCR) and 18 months (antibody test)\nFor a 2-month-old, an Hb of 12 is low; therefore, AZT will not be a good option.

In children, it presents a range of disorders caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. Septic shock, a severe form of sepsis, is defined by persistent hypotension that requires vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mmHg and a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L, despite adequate fluid resuscitation.",

The most infectious source cases are those with sputum smear-positive disease. The closer the contact with this source case, the greater the exposure and the greater the risk of getting infected with tuberculosis.\nTB infection occurs when a person carries the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria inside the body. Many people have TB but are well. A positive tuberculin skin test (TST) suggests infection but a negative TST does not exclude the possibility of infection.\nTB disease occurs in someone with TB infection when the bacteria inside the body start to multiply and become numerous enough to damage one or more organs of the body. This damage causes clinical symptoms and signs. This is referred to as “tuberculosis” or active disease.\nClose contact is defined as living in the same household as, or in frequent contact with (e.g. caregiver, school staff), a source case with PTB.\nMultidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is caused by M. tuberculosis strains that are resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin.\nPre-extensively drug-resistant TB (Pre-XDR): TB caused by M. tuberculosis strains that fulfil the definition of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinolone.\nExtensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB): TB caused by M. tuberculosis strains that fulfil the definition of MDR/RR-TB and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one additional Group A medicine.

Further, immune cells are recruited to wall off the infected macrophages, forming granuloma, the hallmark of TB. Healthy individuals remain latently infected, and the infection is kept at bay at this stage, but it is prone to the risk of reactivation. As the granuloma develops, the bacilli emerge from the macrophages. When the reactivation occurs, M. tb proliferates, the bacterial load becomes overwhelmingly high, and the granuloma ruptures, disseminating the bacteria to the airways. The bacilli are then expectorated as contagious aerosol droplets, restarting the cycle, and infecting other individuals.(Alsayed and Gunosewoyo 2023)",

It is helpful to note that close contact may be at school in a classroom, dormitory/ school bus, or church. Sometimes, it may be someone who frequently visits the child’s home or a caregiver. In childhood, it may take between 3 months to 2 years from the time of exposure to develop TB disease.\nHistory of symptoms suggestive of TB\nMore commonly children with TB will present with the following symptoms:\n\nCough of any duration or progressive non-remitting cough which may be dry or wet.\nFever (persistent or unexplained)\nLethargy/reduced playfulness/less active\nPoor weight gain or weight loss or very low weight (failure to thrive), flattened growth curve is a very sensitive marker of disease. More specifically it is important to plot the measurement and compare it to previous charts on the growth charts in the child health record booklet\nNight sweat. Since most children sweat at night, it is usually difficult to establish this symptom.\n\nPhysical Examination (Some clinical findings suggestive of PTB)\nGeneral Examination\n\nFever- Temperature that remains persistently high or irregular &gt;37.5 (fever)\nWeight- (confirm poor weight gain, recent weight loss): the weight should be plotted on the child’s growth curve, and any child who “falls off” or is unable to maintain their usual line of growth should be considered as having possible TB\nLength/Height is needed to determine the weight-for-length/height Z-scores (&lt;-3 Z indicates severe wasting)\nMUAC -Middle upper arm circumference of &lt; 12.5 cm\nRespiratory rate - (fast breathing) depends on the patient’s age. (Children 0-2 months above 60cpm, 3 months to 12 months more than 50 CPM and 1-5 years more than 40 CPM)\nSigns of respiratory distress are not specific to TB but must raise the index of suspicion e.g Low oxygen saturation, stridor, and wheezes\n\nPhysical signs suggestive of Extra Pulmonary TB (EPTB) include:\n\nEnlarged cervical lymph nodes which are not painful with or without fistula formation – TB lymphadenopathy;\nPresence of spinal kyphosis (angular swelling) – spinal TB (“gibbous”);\nSigns of non-acute meningitis with poor response to antibiotic treatment and/or with raised intracranial pressure – TB Meningitis;\nPleural effusion, especially one-sided dullness with pleuritic pain in a child who is not acutely ill – pleural TB;\nPericardial effusion, distant or muffled heart sounds or signs of new-onset heart failure – pericardial TB;\nNon-acute distended abdomen with or without ascites – abdominal TB;\nNon-tender swollen joints with painful or abnormal gait – osteoarticular TB.",

Results are rapid and determine if the patient has a drug-sensitive or resistant organism. Various specimens may be collected, including expectorated sputum, induced sputum, gastric aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, pleural aspirate urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid tissue and, more recently, stool. Other modalities for confirming TB are smear microscopy and TB cultures.\n\n\n36.6.2 Radiologic investigations\nChildren often have paucibacillary TB and therefore bacteriological yields are low. Various imaging modalities can be suggestive of TB. Chest X-ray is the most frequently used radiological imaging. The presence of hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 36.1), effusions, and cavitations could all support the diagnosis of TB in children. Ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI all have roles in suspected extrapulmonary TB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 36.1: Chest X-ray showing perihilar lymphadenopathy suggestive of TB\n\n\n\n\n\n36.6.3 Immunologic investigations\nImmunological tests provide evidence for TB infection but not TB disease.

Rifampicin + Isoniazid (RH) 75/50 mg\n\nEvery child receives 2RHZE ( 2 months intensive phase)/4RH (4 months continuation phase) for all forms of TB except TB meningitis and osteoarticular TB where the continuation phase is extended for 10 months (10 RH). For non-severe TB (refer to further reading) 2RHZE/2RH regimen can be applied.\nNote:\nCorticosteroids are often used as an adjunct in the treatment of these forms of TB to prevent complications. These include TB Meningitis; TB Pericarditis; and Pott disease/ TB Spondylitis. Pleural diseases, and Endobronchial TB\nPyridoxine (Vitamin B6) supplement is necessary in some patients to prevent peripheral neuropathy but recommended in ALL HIV-infected persons and severely acute malnourished patients on isoniazid\n\n\n36.7.2 Major side effects\nPotential side effects of TB medications are:\n\nRifampicin: Orange-colored urine, saliva or tears, jaundice\nPyrazinamide: GI disturbances, hepatotoxicity\nEthambutol: GI disturbances, blurred vision\nIsoniazid: numbness and tingling in the extremities, GI disturbances, rash\n\n\n\n36.7.3 TB Preventive Therapy\nEvery person living with HIV should be given TB preventive therapy (TPT) after screening and ruling out active TB disease. Other categories of children requiring TPT after ruling out TB disease are:\n\nNewborns of mothers with TB,\nAll Children exposed to an index case with sputum-positive TB,\nLong-term steroids, and immunocompromised children.\n\nIf a patient develops TB disease, the patient should be investigated, and treatment changed from TPT to full treatment. There are four(4) options for TPT in children:\n\nRifapentine + Isoniazid- weekly for 3 months\nRifampicin + isoniazid – daily for 3 months\nRifampicin- daily for 4 months\nIsoniazid only – daily for 6 months",

    "text": "36.12 Sample case scenarios\nQuestion\n\nA mother delivers a newborn at 40 weeks gestation. Within the last 4 weeks of pregnancy, she started coughing. She bought cough syrup and amoxicillin at a dispensary. Her coughing got severe and she noted weight loss. At week 39, she visited the hospital and was diagnosed with TB (GeneXpert MTB positive and RIF sensitive). She was started on treatment immediately. She lives in a single room with her 3 other children who are 2 years, 8 years, and 10 years respectively who were all clinically well except the 2 years old who weighed 8 kgs.\n\nIdentify risks of infection for the children\nIdentify risks of disease in children\nHow would you approach the management of the children\n\n\nAnswers\n\nThe risks of infection in the above scenario are sputum-positive MTB on GeneXpert tests and the single room is occupied by a single mother and her children.\nThe risk of TB disease will be in the newborn and the 2-year-old sibling who is already failing to thrive. If the mother has HIV or the children are not immunised with BCG, that would also be a risk factors for disease.\nAll the children have been exposed to TB through a close contact, who happens to be their mother. The mother has to be tested for HIV. If she is positive, all the children should also be tested. All the children would have to be screened for TB. The newborn should ideally not be given BCG vaccine but put on TPT if TB disease is excluded. The recommended TPT will depend on the HIV status of the newborn, but Isoniazid is an option for 6 months. After 6 months of INH, if there is no evidence that the newborn has been exposed to TB (Mantoux testing), the child can be given BCG vaccine. If the newborn has the disease, then full TB treatment should be given. The 2-year-old weighs 8 kg which is evidence of weight faltering. Plot the weight for age on the Z-score. Do other investigations such as Chest X-ray, stool for Xpert, and HIV testing. If the clinical, bacteriological, and imaging are suggestive of TB, treat the 2-year-old. If HIV is positive, remember to adjust the dose of ARVs that interact with rifampicin during TB treatment. If the screening of the 8 and 10 years is normal, then put them on TPT, otherwise treat them\n\nSelf-assessment questions\n\nA 5-year-old boy diagnosed with TB and started on RHZE complained to his mother that he finds it difficult to see clearly what his school teacher has projected in class. Which of the following medications is likely responsible?\n\nIsoniazid\nPyrazinamide\nEthambutol\nRifampicin\n\nExplain why bacteriological yield from children with suspected PTB is often very low.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlsayed, Shahinda S.

    "text": "37.14 Practical work\n\n37.14.1 Question\nA 4-month-old baby is presented with fever, cough, and rhinorrhoea of 2 days duration. O/E:  Active, healthy-looking child with occasional smiles; axillary temp 37.8 °C.  The baby is treated for the common cold.  Baby has no scar over the Left deltoid area and on enquiry has visited the immunization clinic two times since birth, but has misplaced the weighing card.\n\nWhich vaccinations will the child require at that age?\nWhich vaccinations are contraindicated?\nWhich ones should the child receive before going home?\nWhen should the child be returned for follow-up vaccinations? And for which vaccines?\nWhat if the baby’s mother is HIV-positive?\nWhat if there is a parental history of SCD?\n\n\n\n37.14.2 Answers\nThe baby should have received several routine vaccinations at four months old according to Ghana’s Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). Based on the standard schedule, the following vaccines are typically required at this age:\nVaccinations Required at Four Months\n\nOral Polio Vaccine (OPV) – Third dose\nPentavalent Vaccine (DPT/HiB/HepB) – Third dose (protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and hepatitis B)\nPneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) – Third dose\nRotavirus Vaccine – Second dose\n\nContraindicated Vaccines\n\nLive vaccines such as BCG (for tuberculosis) and Measles-Rubella (MR) may be contraindicated if the child has certain immunodeficiencies, such as HIV/AIDS, or other medical conditions. However, specific contraindications should be assessed by a healthcare provider.\n\nVaccines to Receive Before Going Home\n\nSince the baby has visited the immunization clinic only twice and has no visible BCG scar, verifying which vaccines have been missed is crucial. Before discharge, the baby should receive any missed doses of the routine vaccines, particularly BCG if it was not previously administered.\n\nFollow-up Vaccinations and Schedule\nThe baby should return for the next scheduled vaccinations:\n\nAt 6 months – Vitamin A supplementation\nAt 9 months – Measles-Rubella (MR) and Yellow Fever vaccines\nAt 12 months – Meningococcal vaccine (Men A) and second dose of Measles-Rubella (MR)\n\nConsiderations for Special Cases\n\nIf the mother is HIV-positive: The baby may require additional monitoring and possible adjustments to the vaccination schedule. BCG may be contraindicated if the baby is symptomatic or severely immunocompromised.\nIf there is a parental history of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): The baby should be screened for sickle cell status. Additional precautions may be needed if diagnosed with SCD, including early pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines to prevent infections.",

It is a malignant disorder of the blood and bone marrow characterised by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal white blood cells. These immature cells crowd the marrow, impairing the production of normal blood cells and leading to anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. For medical students, understanding leukaemia requires an integrated view of its epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes.\nLeukaemia in children is a heterogeneous group of disorders arising from the malignant transformation of haematopoietic precursor cells. It is broadly divided into acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the most common type, and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Chronic leukaemias are rare in childhood. The disease disrupts normal bone marrow function and causes systemic manifestations due to infiltration of organs by leukaemic cells.",

They account for approximately 10–15% of childhood malignancies. Lymphomas are broadly classified into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with the latter being more frequent in children. Among NHL subtypes, Burkitt’s lymphoma is particularly common in tropical Africa, including Ghana, where it is one of the leading childhood cancers.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment of childhood lymphoma is vital for medical students, as early diagnosis and timely intervention significantly improve outcomes.\nLymphoma is a malignancy of the lymphoid system, originating from either B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes at various stages of differentiation. In children, the disease behaves more aggressively compared to adult lymphomas, but it is also more curable with modern treatment protocols.",

In sub-Saharan Africa, data are scarce, but renal disease often presents late and is associated with preventable causes such as infections, dehydration, and toxins.\nIn Ghana, children frequently present with conditions such as nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, urinary tract infections, and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Early childhood illnesses, poor sanitation, and limited access to pediatric nephrology care contribute to adverse outcomes.",

Immune-mediated mechanisms — such as deposition of immune complexes following infections — play a central role.\n\n\n46.4.2 Tubulointerstitial and Tubular Disorders\nTubular diseases interfere with urine concentration, electrolyte handling, and acid-base balance.\n- Renal tubular acidosis leads to metabolic acidosis due to defective hydrogen ion excretion or bicarbonate reabsorption.\n- Fanconi syndrome affects multiple tubular transport mechanisms, leading to glycosuria, aminoaciduria, and phosphate wasting.\n\n\n46.4.3 Vascular and Systemic Disorders\nConditions such as hemolytic uremic syndrome cause endothelial injury leading to microangiopathic hemolysis and acute renal failure. Hypertension, both a cause and consequence of renal disease, damages glomeruli and accelerates progression to chronic kidney disease.\n\n\n46.4.4 Congenital and Structural Anomalies\nCAKUT accounts for a significant proportion of pediatric renal failure. These abnormalities arise during embryogenesis and include renal agenesis, dysplasia, and obstructive lesions. Impaired nephron development or chronic obstruction eventually results in renal scarring and progressive dysfunction.",

Disease-Specific Therapy\n\nNephrotic syndrome: corticosteroids are first-line; resistant cases may need cyclophosphamide or calcineurin inhibitors.\n\nAcute glomerulonephritis: mainly supportive; antibiotics for streptococcal infection; control of hypertension and edema.\n\nUTIs: treated with appropriate antibiotics and preventive measures such as hydration and bladder hygiene.\n\nObstructive uropathy: surgical intervention to relieve obstruction.\n\nAKI: manage underlying cause, ensure adequate perfusion, and initiate dialysis when necessary.\n\nCKD: slow progression through blood pressure control, treat anemia, and prepare for renal replacement therapy.\n\n\n\n46.7.3 3. Dialysis and Renal Replacement\nIndicated in severe AKI or end-stage renal disease.\n- Peritoneal dialysis is often preferred in children due to simplicity and better hemodynamic tolerance.\n- Haemodialysis is used in older children when facilities permit.\n- Kidney transplantation offers the best long-term outcome, though access is limited in Ghana.\n\n\n46.7.4 4.

    "text": "47.2 Ways of measuring blood pressure\n\nDirect intra-arterial measurements by placing a catheter into the vessel and measuring the pressure “in line” with the vessel (end-on-pressure). This method is used by physiologists and Intensivists. The principle is employed in the measurements of central venous pressure and intracranial pressure in clinical practice.\nThe auscultatory method is done with the use of a sphygmomanometer (either mercury or aneroid) and a stethoscope. This is the gold standard in clinical practice. Korotkoff sounds 1 and 5 sounds are measured for systolic and diastolic bleed pressures respectively. Values obtained are generally lower than direct & oscillometric measurements.\nThe palpation method (flush technique) is performed with the use of a sphygmomanometer and palpating finger. Largely unreliable. Only systolic blood pressure can be measured with this technique. The palpated pulse is generally lower than Korotkoff sound 1 by 10mmHg.\nThe oscillometric method uses a sphygmomanometer and a monitor e.g. digital blood pressure devices and Dynamap. Here, pulsatile blood flow through arterial wall oscillations is transmitted to the cuff encircling the extremity. Korotkoff sound 1 is recorded at the point of rapid increase in oscillation amplitude. Korotkoff sound 5 is recorded as the point of a sudden decrease in oscillation amplitude. Values obtained by oscillometric measurements are generally higher than auscultatory.\nDoppler ultrasound technique: Here a Doppler ultrasound is held over the pulse to magnify the sound so that it is audible without a stethoscope. The sound detected may be 5mmHg higher than Korotkoff sound 1.\nAmbulatory blood pressure measurements. Here, multiple measurements are recorded over time (e.g. 24 hours) with digital devices attached to the limb whilst the patient engages in normal activities outside the hospital. Results are analysed on a computer or paper tracer built into the device using the mean of the readings. It provides a truer picture of blood pressure trends useful in diagnosing “white coat hypertension” and nocturnal hypertension (absence of a normal physiological drop in blood pressure during sleep).",

The inability of cerebral vasculature to constrict appropriately in response to the abrupt increase in cerebral blood flow leads to cerebral hyperperfusion.

It is characterised by haematuria, mild-to-moderate proteinuria, oedema, hypertension, and varying degrees of renal impairment. Unlike nephrotic syndrome, in which protein loss predominates, nephritic syndrome reflects glomerular injury due to immune-mediated inflammation, leading to red cell leakage and reduced glomerular filtration.\nIn Ghana, as in many developing countries, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) remains the most common cause in children. However, other glomerulonephritides such as lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy are also encountered.\nUnderstanding nephritic syndrome is important because timely diagnosis and appropriate management can prevent progression to chronic kidney disease.",

It may occur acutely, following a transient insult to the kidneys, or chronically, as the final stage of progressive renal disease. Understanding the causes, pathophysiology, clinical features, investigations, and management of kidney failure is critical for all medical students and healthcare providers involved in child health.\nKidney failure refers to the inability of the kidneys to perform their normal regulatory, excretory, and endocrine functions. In children, it can present as acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI involves a rapid decline in renal function over hours or days, while CKD involves irreversible deterioration over months or years. The distinction is important because their causes, management, and outcomes differ.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, the prevalence of kidney failure is underestimated due to limited diagnostic resources. However, hospital-based data show that AKI is a common complication of severe infections, dehydration, and nephrotoxic exposure in children, while CKD often results from congenital anomalies or glomerular diseases.",

    "text": "55.1 Introduction\nCentral nervous system (CNS) infections are among the most serious medical conditions affecting children, often leading to high morbidity and mortality if not promptly diagnosed and treated. They include infections that involve the brain (encephalitis), meninges (meningitis), or both (meningoencephalitis). In sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, CNS infections are common due to the high burden of bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal diseases. Understanding the pathophysiology, presentation, and management of these infections is crucial for all medical students and clinicians caring for children.\nCNS infections encompass a spectrum of conditions caused by microorganisms that invade the central nervous system, leading to inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, or their protective coverings. The major forms are:\nThese infections are medical emergencies. Early diagnosis and aggressive management can prevent death and long-term neurological sequelae such as hearing loss, seizures, and cognitive impairment.",

    "text": "56.1.1 Definition\nCerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of movement and/or posture resulting from non-progressive (static) disturbances (insult/injury) to the developing foetal or infant brain.\nAlthough the injury is non-progressive (static), the neurological manifestations evolve.\nDisturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behaviour, by epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal problems, often accompany the motor disorders of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy was first described by Dr William Little in 1860. It is also known as Little’s disease, cerebral paralysis, or static encephalopathy. It is usually evident by the time a child is 2 years old. The incidence is approximately 2.2 per 1,000 live births in well-resourced countries. The incidence is higher in lower- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of physical disability in children. It is associated with multiple comorbidities.\n\n\n56.1.2 Classification of cerebral palsy\nCerebral palsy is traditionally classified based on the nature of the motor disorder (tone abnormality) and its topographical distribution. Using the motor disorder classification, cerebral palsy is categorized as spastic (pyramidal), dyskinetic (extrapyramidal or athetoid), ataxic, hypotonic, or mixed. Using the topographic distribution, cerebral palsy is classified as quadriplegia, diplegia, hemiplegia, triplegia, and monoplegia.\nRecent classifications of cerebral palsy describe the functional assessment of motor abilities using an objective scale. Examples include:\n\nGross Motor Functional Classification Scale (GMFCS) for gross motor function\nManual Ability Classification System (MACS) for upper limb function\nCommunication Functional Classification System (CFCS) for communication\nEating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) for eating and Drinking\n\n\n\n56.1.3 Aetiology and Risk Factors\nThe risk factors and aetiologies of CP can be grouped based on the timing of the insult as genetic, preconceptional, prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal.\nGenetic causes/risk factors include\n\nChromosomal syndromes\nSingle gene or microdeletion syndromes\n\nPreconceptional risk factors include:\n\nMaternal illness—seizures, intellectual disability, thyroid disease, iodine deficiency\nMaternal history of stillbirth or neonatal death\nMaternal age over 40\nLow socio-economic status\n\nPrenatal risk factors\n\nIntrauterine infections (TORCHES)\nPlacental abnormalities\nBleeding in the second or third trimesters\nEclampsia/pre-eclampsia\n\nChorioamnionitis\n\nMaternal drug use, e.g., alcohol, cocaine, cigarette\nOligo/polyhydramnios\nIntrauterine growth restriction\nMultiple pregnancy\n\nPerinatal risk factors\n\nFoetal distress\nDifficult deliveries\nBreech delivery\nProlonged labour\nInstrumental deliveries incl. emergency caesarean section\nMeconium aspiration\nBirth asphyxia à Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy\nBirth injuries affecting the brain\n\nPostnatal risk factors\n\nPrematurity\nLow birth weight\nRespiratory distress syndrome\nHypoglycaemia\nKernicterus à bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction\nNeonatal seizures\nInfections, e.g., meningitis, encephalitis\nTrauma à head injuries\nChild abuse, e.g., shaken baby syndrome\nStrokes\nSubmersion injuries",

It results from injury to the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract or the motor cortex. The features are usually not present at birth, but develop within the first 2 years of life, and include:\n\nDelayed motor milestones\nHypertonia (spasticity)\nHyperreflexia\nSeizures\nIntellectual/learning disability\n\nSpastic CP is further classified based on the anatomical distribution as:\n\nMonoplegia\nDiplegia\nHemiplegia\nTriplegia\nQuadriplegia\n\n\n56.2.1.1 Spastic hemiplegia\nThis is when the weakness is on one side of the body. On the affected side, the upper limb is usually more severely affected than the lower limb. It results from focal pathology in the cerebral cortex, often due to cerebral malformations or vascular causes such as intrauterine haemorrhage.\nEarly manifestations of spastic hemiplegia include:\n\nFisting on the affected side\nEarly handedness (lateralization before 1 year of age)\nDelayed sitting (falls over as affected leg hyper-extends)\nThe child does not bear weight on the affected side when held upright\nMay not be recognized until 5-6 months of age or later\n\nLate manifestations of spastic hemiplegia include:\n\nSpastic hemiplegic CP is the most ambulatory form of CP. They typically walk independently by the age of 3.\nTiptoe walking in the affected foot\nHemiplegic gait/hemiparesis\nSeizures may occur in 50-60% of patients, usually in the first 2 years of life.\nIntelligence may not be affected\n\n\n\n56.2.1.2 Spastic diplegia\nThis affects all four limbs, but the lower limbs are severely affected, leaving the upper limbs relatively spared. Common etiologic or risk factors are prematurity and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the preterm infant. The pathological finding in the brain is periventricular leukomalacia.\nEarly manifestations in infants with spastic diplegia:\n\nThey are usually alert and have good socialization\nTheir hands open (no fisting)\nThey have a normal tone (or even hypotonia) during the first 4 months\nDelayed motor milestones (They delay in sitting and often extend their legs when pulled to sit).\n\nLate manifestations of spastic diplegia:\n\nThey later develop increased tone in the lower limbs (especially in the hip adductors, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius)\nAlso, increased deep tendon reflexes, clonus, and Babinski sign in the lower limbs.\nCommando crawling, bottom shuffling, or rolling movement\nScissoring gait and tiptoeing when pulled to stand\nDelayed walking\nHip subluxation in children with severe lower limb spasticity\nUsually normal intelligence\nUsually no seizures\n\n\n\n56.2.1.3 Spastic quadriplegia\nIn this type of cerebral palsy, all four limbs are affected. It also affects the face, neck, and trunk. It is caused by diffuse brain injury, such as:\n\nHypoxic-ischemic damage in a term infant\nIntrauterine disease\nCerebral malformations\n\nThe typical pathological findings are watershed infarcts.\nEarly manifestations of spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy are\n\nPoor socialization\nPoor neck control\nInfantile reflexes (Moro and tonic-neck) are obligatory, stereotyped, and persist after age 6 months\nThe patient may be hypotonic in infancy and later evolve into spasticity.\nCortical fisting in both hands\n\nLate manifestations of spastic quadriplegia include:\n\nSevere to profound global developmental\nMicrocephaly\nSeizures are common\nSevere intellectual disability\nDiffused increased tone\nIncreased deep tendon reflexes, clonus, Babinski sign\nSupranuclear bulbar palsy (dysphagia, dysarthria) presenting as drooling and recurrent aspirations.\nThey may never walk or sit alone\nThey tend to have cortical visual impairment, disturbances in ocular motility, and hearing impairment.\n\nLess common forms of spastic cerebral palsy are spastic triplegia and spastic monoplegia.\nFigure 56.1 summarises the types of spastic cerebral palsy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 56.1: Types of spastic cerebral palsy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56.2.2 Dyskinetic cerebral palsy\nThis is also called extrapyramidal/choreoathetoid cerebral palsy. Common aetiologies for this form of cerebral palsy include kernicterus and sudden hypoxic-ischaemic episodes, as in uterine rupture or placenta abruptio. The brain pathology shows damage in the extrapyramidal system and the basal ganglia.\nEarly manifestations of dyskinetic cerebral palsy include:\n\nNo choreoathetosis in the first 2 years of life\nOften hypotonic, but sometimes presents with fluctuating muscle tone\nDelayed motor milestones\nPoor neck control\nSensorineural deafness\nNormal socialization\n\nLate manifestations include:\n\nMovement disorders: Choreoathetosis, dystonia\nSymmetrical distribution\nDental enamel dysplasia\nDifficulty with speech (dysarthria)\nSwallowing difficulty leading to drooling\nAffected children may or may not walk independently\nIntelligence can be normal\nSeizures are not common\n\n\n\n56.2.3 Ataxic cerebral palsy\nThis results from damage to the cerebellum. Patients experience problems with balance and deep perception, presenting with an unsteady gait and difficulty with movement that requires a lot of control, such as writing. Their muscle tone may be increased or decreased.\n\n\n56.2.4 Mixed cerebral palsy\nPatients with mixed cerebral palsy have more than one type of cerebral palsy, usually a mixture of spasticity and athetoid movements, with tight muscle tone and involuntary reflexes. In mixed CP, different parts of the brain are affected.

The CT is used in children &gt;1 year old due to the risk associated with radiation in younger children, while the MRI is helpful at any age. However, the MRI is more challenging to perform due to its limited availability, high cost, and the prolonged sedation required.",

These include tonic (stiffening), clonic (jerking), myoclonic (massive jerking), vibratory (trembling), or hypermotor (thrashing about). Seizures with no motor manifestations are termed non-convulsive and include motor arrest, e.g., unresponsive stare or drop attacks. Sensory disturbances during a seizure may include visual, auditory, or tactile disturbances. Some patients may describe changes in smell or taste.\nNon-epileptic seizures in children include many events such as cardiac syncope, vasovagal syncope, breath-holding spells, infantile gratification, shuddering spells, etc. These are sometimes referred to as seizure mimics.",

In this classification, seizures are broadly classified based on their onset within the brain as focal, generalized, or unknown onset.\n\nFocal-onset seizures originate from a focus within one hemisphere.\nGeneralized-onset seizures originate from both hemispheres.\nUnknown onset – where the onset is not known at the time of the evaluation.\n\nFocal-onset seizures (previously known as partial seizures) are further subclassified based on whether awareness is preserved or lost during the seizure and secondary generalization.\n\nFocal seizures with intact awareness (or focal aware seizures): These are focal seizures in which awareness is preserved. This was previously known as simple partial seizures.\nFocal seizures with loss of awareness (or focal unaware seizures): These are focal seizures in which awareness is lost during the event. They were previously referred to as complex partial seizures.\nFocal seizures evolving into bilateral tonic-clonic seizures: These are focal seizures that go on to become generalized. They were previously referred to as focal seizures with secondary generalization.\n\nGeneralised-onset seizures are further subclassified based on their manifestations as:\n\nClonic seizures: having repetitive jerky movements.\nTonic seizures: characterised by increased tone.\nTonic-clonic seizures: They have two phases: a tonic phase and a clonic phase.\nTonic-clonic-tonic, or other combinations\nAtonic seizures: These are characterized by loss of muscle tone, leading to drop attacks.\nMyoclonic seizures: These are characterized by sudden jerks of a group of muscles.\nAbsence seizures: These are characterized by blank stares during which the patient loses awareness. They may be associated with lip-smacking or eyelid fluttering. A typical absence seizure starts abruptly, lasts about 5-15 seconds, and ends abruptly with no postictal events. An atypical absence may last &gt;15 seconds or may have a slow recovery. \nEpileptic spasms: These are characterized by repetitive flexor (or extensor) jerks of the limbs and trunk, occurring in clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 57.1: ILAE classification of seizures",

It affects about 3% of all children between 6 months and 6 years old.\nBiological Basis\nThe exact mechanism leading to febrile seizures is not clearly understood; biology is related to the immature brain in young children, fever, and genetic predisposition. The fever activates the cytokine networks (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta), increasing neuronal excitability. There is a complex inheritance involving multiple genes and environmental factors for children with genetic predisposition. Monozygotic twins have a higher concordance rate than dizygotic twins.\nThe risk for a first febrile seizure in a child is increased in those with\n\nDelayed neonatal hospital discharge\nSlow neurological development as judged by the parent\nFamily history of febrile seizures (especially in a first-degree relative)\nAttendance at day care\n\n\n\n57.4.2 Etiology\nCommon causes of febrile seizures include malaria, URTI, otitis media, pharyngitis, transient viral infections, and gastroenteritis. Some children develop a fever following vaccination with whole-cell DPT or measles vaccine.\n\n\n57.4.3 Classification\nFebrile seizures are classified as simple or complex. Table 57.1 below shows the differences between simple and complex febrile seizures.\n\n\n\nTable 57.1: Simple versus Complex Febrile Seizures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nSimple febrile seizure\nComplex febrile seizure\n\n\n\n\nSeizure type\nGeneralized\nMaybe focal\n\n\nDuration\nBrief (&lt;15 min)\nProlonged\n\n\nNumber of episodes\nSingle episode during the febrile illness\nRepeated episodes in the same illness\n\n\nOutcomes\nDo not cause brain damage\nIncreased risk of brain damage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57.4.4 Risk of recurrence\nIn children with febrile seizures, the risk factors for recurrence are\n\nYoung age at the time of the first febrile seizure (&lt; 15 months)\nFamily history of febrile seizures (first-degree relative)\nLow temperature at the time of the seizure (&lt; 40 degrees)\nShort duration of illness before the seizure          [Berg et al, 1997]\n\nHaving a complex febrile seizure and neurologic dysfunction are not consistent predictors of recurrence.\n\n\n57.4.5 Risk of subsequent epilepsy\nThe risk of epilepsy in children with febrile seizures is slightly higher than the incidence in the general population. The risk is increased with:\n\nComplex febrile seizures (focal, prolonged, repeated within a single illness)\nDevelopmental delay or neurologic dysfunction\nFamily history of epilepsy                                                                     \n\nThe number of febrile seizures is not a predictor of subsequent epilepsy.\n\n\n57.4.6 Long-term cognitive and behavioural outcomes\nFebrile seizures are “benign”.

    "section": "57.5 Acute scenarios: prolonged seizures versus status epilepticus",
    "text": "57.5 Acute scenarios: prolonged seizures versus status epilepticus\n\n57.5.1 Definitions:\nProlonged seizures: Most convulsive seizures in children are brief (lasting &lt; 3 minutes). However, some may go on beyond 5 minutes. These are termed prolonged seizures.\nStatus epilepticus, on the other hand, is a prolonged seizure lasting more than 30 minutes or multiple seizures without recovery of consciousness. This definition applies to convulsive seizures. The duration of non-convulsive seizures differs based on the seizure type.\n\n\n57.5.2 Pathophysiology of status epilepticus\nIn the initial seizure phase, the body undergoes autoregulation, leading to increased heart rate, cardiac output, and cerebral perfusion. This ensures that there is increased oxygen and glucose delivery to the brain. Also, increased cerebral perfusion helps remove carbon dioxide and metabolic waste, which build up in the brain during seizures. Beyond 30 minutes, this autoregulation breaks down, reducing cardiac output, decreasing systemic blood pressure, and decreasing cerebral perfusion. In the end, there is decreased oxygenation (hypoxia) and buildup of metabolic waste, which trigger a cascade of events with resultant neuronal deaths. This is why it is essential to stop any seizure from progressing into a status epilepticus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 57.2: Timing of seizures in the acute scenario and the clinical implications\n\n\n\n\n\n57.5.3 The Do’s and Don’ts in acute scenarios\nIn the first few minutes of a seizure, it is essential to undertake basic first aid measures to protect the patient. These are termed the Do’s and include:\n\nProtect the person from injury (eg, remove harmful objects from nearby, cushion their heads, etc.)\nWhen the seizure is over, gently place the patient in recovery. This positioning aids breathing by ensuring the patient does not choke on their secretions.\nStay with the patient until the seizure is over.\nStay calm and reassuring.\n\nSome traditional practices can be harmful and should be discouraged. These are referred to as the Don’ts and include:\n\nDo not restrain the person’s movements. Forcefully restraining their movement does not stop the seizures and may instead result in needless injuries like fractures and dislocations. \nDo not put anything in their mouth. This could lead to the patient biting on the spoon or spatula and causing damage to their teeth, gums, or palate. Also, please do not put your finger in their mouth. A forceful bite on your figure can lead to severe injuries, including amputation.\nDo not try to move them unless they are in danger.\nDo not give them anything to eat or drink until they fully recover.\nDo not attempt to bring them around. Practices such as pouring cold water on the patient, smearing them with garlic or other noxious substances are harmful and do not stop the seizures. \n\nIndications for bringing the patient to the emergency room include:\n\nIf this is the person’s first seizure.\nIf the seizure continues for more than five minutes.\nIf one seizure follows another without the person regaining consciousness between seizures.\nIf the person is injured.\nIf you believe the person needs urgent medical attention.\n\n\n\n57.5.4 General principles of management of Prolonged Seizures and Status Epilepticus\nIn the first 5 minutes, critical interventions should include:\n\nGeneral emergency measures including\n\nA = airway\nB = breathing\nC = circulation\nD = disability (such as hypoglycemia)\nE = exposure\n\nCheck blood glucose and correct hypoglycemia, if present.\nRemember the Do’s and Don’ts.\n\nIf the seizure persists after 5 minutes, initiate drug management.\n\n1st line drugs are benzodiazepines: these commonly include diazepam (rectal/IV, midazolam (buccal/nasal), and lorazepam (IV/rectal). These may be repeated after 10 minutes if the seizure persists.\n2nd line drugs include phenobarbital (IV), phenytoin (IV), valproate (IV), or levetiracetam (IV).\n3rd line drugs include anesthetic agents and should be given in the intensive care unit or in a center where the patient’s breathing can be supported. They include thiopentone, propofol, and ketamine. Alternatively, continuous infusions of midazolam or repeated intravenous boluses of phenobarbitone may be used.\n\nThis stepwise approach to the management of ongoing seizures is illustrated in Table 57.2 below:\n\n\n\nTable 57.2: Stepwise approach to status epilepticus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\nAction required\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nt = 0 (seizure onset)\nEnsure patient’s safety (remember the Do’s and Don’ts) Check the ABCDs.\n\nEnsure airway patency.\nMonitor vitals (HR, RR, BP, SpO2)\nIf SpO2 &lt;90%, give supplemental O2\nSecure venous access\nCheck RBS. If there is hypoglycemia, correct with dextrose.\n\nMost seizures will stop on their own within 3 minutes of onset.\n\n\nt = 5 min\nStart 1st line pharmacologic treatment with a benzodiazepine.\nCommonly used benzodiazepines include:\n\nDiazepam (rectal or IV)\nMidazolam (buccal or nasal)\nLorazepam (rectal or IV)\n\n\n\nt = 15 min\nIf seizure persists to time t = 15 min (10 minutes after the first benzodiazepine), repeat the dose of benzodiazepine.\nBenzodiazepines may be repeated once only. Avoid &gt;2 doses of benzodiazepines.\n\n\nt = 25 min\nStart the 2nd line pharmacologic treatment.\nCommonly used 2nd line drugs are:\n\nPhenobarbitone (IV)\nPhenytoin (IV)\nSodium valproate (IV)\nLevetiracetam (IV)\n\n\n\nt = 40-60 min\nStart the 3rd line pharmacologic treatment.\nThis stage employs anesthetic agents. It should be done in a center where the patient’s breathing can be supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57.5.5 Prognosis of Status Epilepticus in Children\nIn patients who present with convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), there is a mortality rate of 3-9% within 30 days of the CSE. The mortality rate is worse in low- and middle-income countries.\nIn those who survive, the neurological sequelae depend on the type and duration of the seizure, the patient’s age, and the underlying etiology.\n\nDuration of the SE – the single most important determinant of prognosis. Worse outcome for prolonged SE.\nAge – worse neurological sequelae in infants (30% vs. 6% in older children)\nSeizure type – worse outcome for convulsive SE\nUnderlying etiology",

These are:\n\nFocal epilepsy\nGeneralised epilepsy\nCombined generalised and focal epilepsy\nEpilepsy with unknown seizure type(s)\n\n\n\n57.6.3 Causes\nAll causes of epilepsy can be grouped into six main categories as follows:\n\nStructural: e.g., lissencephaly, tumours, calcifications, post-stroke, tuberous sclerosis complex, etc.\nGenetic: e.g., familial neonatal seizures, Dravet syndrome, etc.\nInfections: e.g., neurocysticercosis, HIV, post-meningitis, etc.\nMetabolic: e.g., hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, inborn errors of metabolism, vitamin deficiency, etc.\nImmune-mediated: autoimmune encephalitis\nUnknown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 57.3: ILAE classification of epilepsies\n\n\n\n\n\n57.6.4 Clinical evaluation of the child with epilepsy\nIn evaluating a child with epilepsy, it is important to obtain a good history, perform a thorough physical examination, and then form a clinical diagnosis (or impression). Investigations are then employed to define the seizure type(s), confirm the clinical diagnosis, identify the underlying etiology, assess the effect of treatment, rule out differential diagnoses, and evaluate comorbidities.\nHistory: An eyewitness account is useful when taking the history of a child with epilepsy. Ask the older child for an account of the episodes. Home videos of the seizure episodes, if available, will complement the history. Key aspects of the seizure history should include:\n\nAge at onset: This is important in making an epilepsy syndrome diagnosis, as specific epilepsy syndromes have different ages at onset.\nPatient’s baseline neurological status: This may differ from patient to patient and becomes essential in clinical decision-making. For example, the approach to a 3-year-old previously healthy child presenting with seizures will be different from that of a 3-year-old known with cerebral palsy, which will also be different from another 3-year-old known with HIV infection.\nSeizure semiology: This is a detailed description of what happened during the seizure. It is useful to describe the seizure semiology in terms of the different stages, namely the aura (if any), the ictal event, and the postictal event.\nThe aura is often a sensory feeling that the patient experiences at the start of the seizure. It is seen in focal-onset seizures. Please note that younger children may not be able to describe an aura.\nDescription of the ictal event should include the seizure type (or types), non-motor manifestations (such as behavioral arrest, autonomic dysfunctions, etc.), seizure progression and duration, as well as timing of the events (e.g. shortly after going to sleep, during sleep, on awakening, whilst watching television, etc.).\nPost-ictal events: This is a description of what the patient does after the seizures have stopped. They include events such as falling into deep sleep, changes in behaviour or mood, transient focal weakness (Todd paralysis), etc. Please note that some seizure types (e.g., absence seizures) have abrupt recovery with no post-ictal phase. If there are post-ictal events, the duration should also be noted.\nDevelopmental/cognitive outcome and co-morbidities: The seizure history should describe the patient’s development and any cognitive fallouts or neurobehavioral comorbidities noted since the onset of the seizures.\nDrug history: This should include a detailed list of all anti-seizure medications used in the past, their contribution to seizure control, and the reason for stopping the drug. Other long-term medications (including herbs) and known allergies should also be described.\nFamily history: If other family members have seizures, they should be described in detail, including their relation to the index patient, the seizure type(s), response to treatment, prognosis, etc. \n\nPhysical examination\nThe purpose of the physical examination is to identify risk factors and comorbidities associated with epilepsy and evaluate treatment effectiveness. The initial examination should be comprehensive and include anthropometry, a skin examination for neurocutaneous manifestations, a detailed neurological assessment, a developmental evaluation, and an examination of other systems.\n\n\n57.6.5 Investigations\nIt is important to remember that the diagnosis of epilepsy is mostly clinical and that the clinician should not overrely on investigations. However, investigations may be useful in diagnosing epilepsy syndrome, identifying the underlying etiology, assessing the effect of treatment, ruling out differential diagnoses, and evaluating comorbidities.\nBasic investigations in the evaluation of the child with epilepsy include:\n\nBlood counts\nSerum electrolytes\nLiver function and renal function tests\n\nAdvanced investigations include:\n\nElectroencephalogram (EEG)\nNeuroimaging (CT, MRI, SPECT, PET)\nMetabolic screening\nAutoimmune antibody assays\nMolecular genetic testing\n\n\n\n57.6.6 Treatment of Epilepsy\nThe various modalities for treating epilepsy include:\n\nMedical treatment – traditional and newer Anti-seizure medications (ASMs)\nHormonal treatment – ACTH or Steroids (Prednisolone) for epileptic spasms\nVitamins – pyridoxine, folinic acid, and biotin for vitamin-responsive seizures\nSurgical treatment\nDietary treatment (ketogenic diet) \n\nMedical treatment: This uses traditional or newer Anti-Seizure Medications (ASMs). Not all children with epilepsy require ASM therapy. When needed, ASM selection should be based on seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, and potential side effects. In a low-resource country, availability and affordability should be considered in ASM selection.\nMonotherapy is always preferred. However, a few patients will require rational polypharmacy. It is essential to select ASM at the minimum dosage that provides reasonable seizure control with minimal adverse effects. ASM therapy may be discontinued after the patient has had 2 years of seizure freedom.\nASMs have a variety of side effects. Some are dose-related and others are idiosyncratic (non-dose related)\nTable 57.3 below shows the traditional anti-seizure medications and their specific indications.\n\n\n\nTable 57.3: Traditional Anti-seizure medications (ASMs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\nIndications\nSide Effects\n\n\n\n\nPhenobarbitone\nStatus epilepticus\nNeonatal seizures\nEpilepsy (both focal and generalized seizures)\nDose-related: Drowsiness, respiratory depression\nIdiosyncratic: Rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n\n\nPhenytoin\nStatus epilepticus\nNeonatal seizures\nPeri-operative seizures\nDose-related: Drowsiness\nChronic toxicity: Gingival hyperplasia, coarse facial features, hirsutism, neuropathy, megaloblastic anemia\nIdiosyncratic: Rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, serum sickness\n\n\nSodium valproate\nBroad spectrum\nGeneralized seizures\nAbsence seizures\nDose-related: Intention tremor, weight gain, polycystic ovaries, teratogenicity (risk of neural tube defects)\nIdiosyncratic: Hepatic failure, pancreatitis\n\n\nCarbamazepine\nFocal seizures\nAvoid in the absence and myoclonic seizures\nDose-related: Dizziness, drowsiness, diplopia, ataxia\nIdiosyncratic: Aplastic anemia, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n\n\nEthosuximide\nAbsence seizures\nDose-related: Dizziness, nausea, weight loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome newer ASMs include Lamotrigine, Topiramate, Levetiracetam, Clonazepam, Clobazam, Vigabatrin (for the treatment of epileptic spasms), Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Felbamate, Oxcarbazepine, Fosphenytoin, Lacosamide, Stiripentol, Tiagabine, and Zonisamide.\nHormonal therapy in the treatment of epilepsy includes:\n\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) – for treatment of epileptic spasms\nPrednisone or prednisolone – for treatment of epileptic spasms, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, etc.\n\nVitamins may be employed in the treatment of some epilepsies (known as vitamin-responsive or vitamin-dependent seizures). These include:\n\nPyridoxine\nFolinic acid\nBiotin\n\nSurgical treatment of epilepsy includes:\n\nFocal resection\nLobectomy\nHemispherectomy\nCorpus callosotomy\nVagus nerve stimulation\n\nKetogenic diet: This employs high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and low-protein diets in treating patients with epilepsy. When used, the patient assumes a fasting state, and the brain relies on fatty acids instead of glucose as the primary source of energy. The exact mechanism of action is not known, but it leads to a reduction in seizure frequency and duration. It is effective for all seizure types.",

    "text": "59.1 Introduction\nNeurocutaneous syndromes, also known as phakomatoses, are a diverse group of congenital disorders characterised by abnormalities of the skin and nervous system, often involving other organs such as the eyes, bones, and endocrine glands. They result primarily from genetic mutations that affect the development and differentiation of tissues derived from the ectoderm. Because both the skin and the nervous system originate from the ectodermal layer during embryogenesis, a developmental insult to this germ layer can explain the frequent coexistence of neurological and cutaneous manifestations.\nRecognition of these disorders is crucial in paediatrics, as cutaneous findings may serve as visible markers of significant underlying neurological disease. Early diagnosis allows for timely surveillance, prevention of complications, and genetic counselling for families. The most common and well-studied neurocutaneous syndromes include Neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2, Tuberous sclerosis complex, Sturge–Weber syndrome, and Von Hippel–Lindau disease. Other less frequent syndromes include Ataxia telangiectasia, Incontinentia pigmenti, and Hypomelanosis of Ito.",

Genetic defects that disrupt the proliferation or migration of neural crest cells, progenitors for melanocytes, Schwann cells, meninges, and components of the peripheral nervous system, underlie most neurocutaneous disorders.\nThese mutations often affect genes involved in tumour suppression, cell growth regulation, and signal transduction pathways, such as the RAS/MAPK and mTOR pathways. The result is dysregulated cell proliferation, hamartoma formation, and predisposition to both benign and malignant tumours.\nThe underlying pathophysiological mechanisms therefore include:\n\nHamartomatous growths in skin, brain, and other organs\nVascular malformations\nAbnormal neuronal migration\nPredisposition to neoplasia",

    "text": "59.4 Major Neurocutaneous Syndromes\n\n59.4.1 Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)\nNF1, also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is the most common neurocutaneous disorder, occurring in about 1 in 3,000 live births. It is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumour suppressor that regulates the RAS pathway.\nKey clinical features:\n\n≥6 café-au-lait macules (&gt;5 mm prepubertal, &gt;15 mm postpubertal)\nAxillary or inguinal freckling\n≥2 neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma\nLisch nodules (iris hamartomas)\nOptic pathway glioma\nBony lesions (e.g., sphenoid dysplasia, pseudoarthrosis)\nA first-degree relative with NF1\n\nNeurological features: learning difficulties, attention deficit, seizures, and risk of intracranial tumours.\nComplications: hypertension due to renal artery stenosis or pheochromocytoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, and scoliosis.\nManagement: multidisciplinary, dermatologic surveillance, annual ophthalmology, developmental assessment, and blood pressure monitoring.\n\n\n59.4.2 Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)\nNF2 results from mutations in the NF2 gene on chromosome 22, which encodes merlin (schwannomin), another tumour suppressor. It is rarer (1 in 25,000 births) and typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood.\nHallmark features:\n\nBilateral vestibular schwannomas causing hearing loss and imbalance\nMeningiomas, spinal schwannomas, and ependymomas\nPosterior subcapsular cataracts in children\n\nCutaneous findings are less prominent than in NF1.\nManagement: MRI surveillance, hearing monitoring, and neurosurgical intervention when necessary.\n\n\n59.4.3 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)\nTSC is an autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin) genes, which regulate the mTOR signalling pathway. It affects about 1 in 6,000 births.\nCutaneous features:\n\nHypomelanotic macules (“ash leaf” spots)\nFacial angiofibromas (adenoma sebaceum)\nShagreen patch (connective tissue nevus)\nPeriungual fibromas\n\nNeurological manifestations:\n\nCortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs)\nEpilepsy (infantile spasms common)\nCognitive impairment and autism spectrum disorder\n\nOther organ involvement:\n\nCardiac rhabdomyomas (often regress spontaneously)\nRenal angiomyolipomas and cysts\nPulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (especially in females)\n\nManagement:\n\nmTOR inhibitors (everolimus, sirolimus) for SEGA or renal angiomyolipomas\nAntiepileptic therapy\nDevelopmental and genetic counselling\n\n\n\n59.4.4 Sturge–Weber Syndrome (SWS)\nSWS is a sporadic neurocutaneous disorder caused by somatic mutations in the GNAQ gene.

Although stroke is far less common in children than in adults, it remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in paediatrics, often resulting in lifelong neurological impairment if not promptly recognized and managed. Understanding the anatomy of cerebral circulation, mechanisms of injury, and approach to management is essential for clinicians caring for children.\nThe brain’s blood supply is derived from two major arterial systems—the anterior circulation from the internal carotid arteries and the posterior circulation from the vertebral arteries.\nVenous drainage occurs through the dural venous sinuses (such as the superior sagittal, straight, and transverse sinuses), which ultimately drain into the internal jugular veins. The integrity of this circulation is critical to maintaining cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.\nIn neonates and infants, cerebral blood flow is more vulnerable to fluctuations in systemic perfusion due to immature autoregulatory mechanisms, predisposing them to ischemic or hemorrhagic events under stress conditions like hypoxia, dehydration, or infection.",

    "text": "69.1 Introduction\nSickle Cell Disease (SCD) represents one of the most important inherited disorders of haemoglobin globally and in Ghana, where it poses a significant public health challenge. It remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality across sub-Saharan Africa, yet it is largely preventable through newborn screening and manageable with timely interventions. Understanding its genetics, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management principles is therefore crucial for every medical student and health professional involved in paediatric care.\nSickle Cell Disease encompasses a group of inherited haemoglobinopathies characterized by the presence of abnormal haemoglobin S (HbS) within red blood cells. When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes, causing the red cells to assume a rigid, sickle-like shape. These sickled cells have a shortened lifespan and tend to obstruct small blood vessels, resulting in chronic haemolytic anaemia, episodic vaso-occlusive crises, and progressive multi-organ damage.\nThe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and primarily affects populations from malaria-endemic regions, where the sickle cell trait confers partial protection against severe Plasmodium falciparum infection. Consequently, the prevalence of the sickle gene is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India.\nIn Ghana, it is estimated that about 2% of newborns are affected by SCD annually, and up to 30% of the population carry the sickle trait (HbAS).",

In SCD, a single-point mutation occurs in the β-globin gene on chromosome 11, substituting valine for glutamic acid at position 6 of the β-chain. This substitution profoundly alters haemoglobin solubility.\nWhen deoxygenated, HbS molecules polymerize into long, rigid fibres, distorting the red blood cells into the characteristic “sickle” shape. These cells are less deformable, leading to vaso-occlusion and premature haemolysis.\nCommon genetic variants of SCD include:\n\nHbSS (Sickle Cell Anaemia) – homozygous state; most severe.\nHbSC disease – compound heterozygote for HbS and HbC.\nSickle β-thalassaemia – combination of HbS with β-thalassaemia mutation (can be mild or severe).",

The institution of newborn screening programs and comprehensive sickle cell clinics, especially in teaching hospitals, has significantly improved survival. Early diagnosis through neonatal screening, coupled with penicillin prophylaxis and immunization, can reduce childhood mortality by up to 70%.",

Their destruction leads to chronic anaemia, jaundice, and compensatory bone marrow expansion. Free haemoglobin released during haemolysis also scavenges nitric oxide, promoting vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction.\n\n\n69.4.2 Vaso-occlusion\nRigid sickled cells adhere to vascular endothelium and obstruct small vessels, resulting in tissue ischemia, infarction, and pain crises. Repeated episodes cause chronic organ damage, particularly in the spleen, kidneys, and bones.\nContributing factors include dehydration, infection, hypoxia, acidosis, and cold exposure — all of which increase sickling tendency.\n\n\n69.4.3 Other Pathophysiological Effects\n\nSplenic dysfunction predisposes to overwhelming infections with encapsulated organisms (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae).\n\nBone marrow hyperactivity can cause skeletal deformities and extramedullary haematopoiesis.\n\nEndothelial activation and chronic inflammation contribute to long-term vasculopathy and pulmonary hypertension.",

In most cases, neonatal jaundice is physiological and resolves within the first week of life. However, when jaundice persists beyond the expected period, it is termed prolonged jaundice, and warrants thorough evaluation to exclude underlying pathology such as biliary atresia, hypothyroidism, or hemolytic disease.\nEarly recognition and appropriate management of prolonged jaundice are essential to prevent complications such as cholestasis, kernicterus, and long-term hepatic injury.",

Breastfeeding (Lactation Failure) Jaundice\n\nSeen in the first week due to inadequate milk intake and dehydration.\nLeads to increased enterohepatic circulation and elevated unconjugated bilirubin.\n\n\n\n76.5.1.3 3. Haemolytic Disorders\n\nABO or Rh incompatibility\nG6PD deficiency (common in Ghana and other African settings)\nHereditary spherocytosis, pyruvate kinase deficiency\nThese conditions cause increased haemolysis and bilirubin production.\n\n\n\n76.5.1.4 4. Hypothyroidism\n\nReduced hepatic conjugation and decreased gut motility leading to prolonged unconjugated jaundice.\n\n\n\n76.5.1.5 5. Crigler–Najjar and Gilbert Syndromes\n\nRare genetic disorders of bilirubin conjugation.\n\nCrigler–Najjar Type I: complete absence of glucuronyl transferase (severe).\nCrigler–Najjar Type II and Gilbert syndrome: partial deficiency.\n\n\n\n\n76.5.1.6 6. Prematurity\n\nImmature hepatic conjugation enzyme systems.\n\n\n\n\n76.5.2 B. Predominantly Conjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia (Cholestatic Jaundice)\nConjugated bilirubin is water-soluble; its presence in serum is always abnormal and indicates hepatocellular or obstructive disease.\n\n76.5.2.1 1. Biliary Atresia\n\nProgressive, idiopathic obliteration of extrahepatic bile ducts.\nPresents with jaundice after 2 weeks, pale (acholic) stools, dark urine, and hepatomegaly.\nRequires urgent surgical intervention (Kasai portoenterostomy).\n\n\n\n76.5.2.2 2. Neonatal Hepatitis (Idiopathic or Infectious)\n\nInflammation and dysfunction of hepatocytes.\nCauses include viral infections (CMV, rubella, hepatitis B, enteroviruses) and bacterial sepsis.\n\n\n\n76.5.2.3 3. Metabolic Disorders\n\nGalactosaemia: deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase leading to liver dysfunction, vomiting, and hypoglycaemia.\nTyrosinaemia type I, α1-antitrypsin deficiency: cause hepatocellular damage and cholestasis.\n\n\n\n76.5.2.4 4. Endocrine Disorders\n\nHypopituitarism, hypothyroidism may present with prolonged conjugated jaundice.\n\n\n\n76.5.2.5 5.

In sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, diarrhoea is a leading cause of outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and deaths among children under five years. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that children under five experience an average of three episodes of diarrhoea per year, contributing to significant nutritional deficits and growth faltering.\nDefinition: Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or watery stools within 24 hours, or a stool consistency that is looser than normal for the individual. In infants on breast milk, frequent passage of soft stools may be normal and should not be mistaken for diarrhoea unless the stools are unusually watery and accompanied by other symptoms such as dehydration or fever.",

Peak incidence is between 6 months and 2 years (weaning period). Seasonality is common — cases often increase during the rainy season due to contamination of water sources. Contributing factors include poor sanitation, inadequate hand hygiene, unsafe drinking water, and improper food handling.",

In resource-limited settings, these deficiencies remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, often coexisting with protein-energy malnutrition and infections.\nThis lecture note reviews the physiology, deficiency states, and clinical manifestations of common vitamin-related pathologies encountered in paediatric practice.",

Mother complains his 2-year-old sister has also developed similar lesions 2 days ago.\n\nWhat is your most likely diagnosis?\nHow will you manage this family?\n\n\n79.2.1 Definition & incidence/prevalence\nImpetigo is a common, contagious superficial skin infection. It is seen in all age groups, most common in infants and children. It can involve any body surface but occurs most often on the exposed parts of the body, especially the face, hands, neck and extremities.\n\n\n79.2.2 Aetiology\nIt is caused by streptococci, staphylococci or both.\n\n\n79.2.3 Pathogenesis\nThere are two classic forms\n\nNon-bullous impetigo – accounts for &gt;70% of cases. It is caused by S. aureus or S. pyogenes. Spread by direct contact or through fomites. It begins with a 1 to 2mm erythematous papule or pustule that soon develops into a thin-roofed vesicle or bulla surrounded by a narrow rim of erythema. The vesicle ruptures easily with the release of a thin, cloudy, yellow fluid that dries, forming a honey-coloured crust, the hallmark of non-bullous impetigo. S. pyogenes may cause post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis if the nephrogenic strain is involved. This is shown in Figure 79.1\nBullous impetigo - This is always caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Presents as flaccid, thin-walled bullae or more commonly, tender, shallow erosions surrounded by a remnant of the blister roof. High reservoir sites include nasal carriage of asymptomatic persons and perineum. This is shown in Figure 79.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 79.1: Non-Bullous Impetigo in a Child\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 79.2: Bullous Impetigo in a child\n\n\n\n\n\n79.2.4 Investigations\nDiagnosis is usually made clinically, however, aspirate of the fluid from the lesion can be sent for culture and sensitivity pattern in extensive cases.\n\n\n79.2.5 Treatment\n\nLocal skin care: cleansing, removal of crust\nMild and localised disease- topical antibiotics e.g. Mupirocin\nIn severe or more widespread diseases – oral antibiotics, e.g.: amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, erythromycin\n\nNote: Staph eradication can be considered in people with recurrent impetigo.",

Ghana, with its mix of rural populations and agriculture-based livelihoods, is home to both venomous and non-venomous snakes. Children are particularly vulnerable due to their small body size, curious nature, and increased exposure during play or farm-related activities. In children, envenomation may have more severe effects compared to adults, necessitating prompt and effective clinical management.\nThis note aims to provide medical students in Ghana with a comprehensive overview of snake bites in children, covering epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, complications, and preventive strategies.",

First described by John Langdon Down in 1866, it occurs due to an extra copy of chromosome 21, which results in overexpression of the genes on this chromosome. Affecting approximately 1 in 700 live births worldwide, Down syndrome is seen across all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. This condition presents with varying degrees of intellectual disability, distinctive physical features, and a predisposition to certain medical conditions. Advances in prenatal screening, early interventions, and supportive care have significantly improved the quality of life and life expectancy for individuals with Down syndrome.",

It is a multisystem condition affecting physical development, cognitive abilities, and susceptibility to specific medical disorders. Based on the genetic cause, Down syndrome is classified into three types:\n\nTrisomy 21 (95%): A result of nondisjunction during meiosis, leading to an extra chromosome 21 in all cells.\nTranslocation (4%): A structural rearrangement where a part of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome, often chromosome 14.\nMosaicism (1%): A mixture of normal and trisomic cells due to a post-zygotic nondisjunction event.",

These include:\n\nDYRK1A: Implicated in cognitive impairment.\nAPP (Amyloid Precursor Protein): Associated with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.\nSOD1 (Superoxide Dismutase 1): Contributes to oxidative stress.\nETS2: May influence craniofacial development.\n\nAdvanced maternal age is a significant risk factor due to increased nondisjunction during oocyte maturation.

The estimated prevalence is approximately 1 in 5,000 live births, but the actual incidence is higher due to early embryonic and fetal losses.

In familial cases, the mother is usually the transmitting parent because a considerable proportion of affected males have problems with fertility. Several mutations in the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have been implicated. Such mutations are currently detected in approximately 70% of cases. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12q24.1 are by far the commonest.

Suggestive findings on prenatal ultrasound scans include lymphatic system anomalies such as increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma and fetal ascites. Other supportive findings include polyhydramnios, short femur length, renal and cardiac defects (particularly pulmonary valve dysplasia) in the fetus. At birth, most affected neonates appear unremarkable. Birth weight and head circumference are usually within the normal range. A cardiac murmur may be detected on routine newborn examination. Male neonates may have cryptorchidism. The affected infant may present with feeding difficulties requiring ongoing nasogastric feeding or gastrostomy, which can impair growth. Talipes equinovarus may be present in 5% of patients. The characteristic facial features of NS become more apparent in early childhood and include a triangular-shaped face, hypertelorism, blue-green irises, down-slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, ptosis, low-set ears with thickened posteriorly rotated auricles, high nasal bridge and upturned nose, short webbed neck and micrognathia. Short stature is present in 85% of cases. Cutaneous features in childhood include lymphedema affecting the lower limbs and genitals, follicular keratosis of the face and extensor surfaces, multiple lentigines and café au lait spots. Musculoskeletal features include a shield chest, cubitus valgus, pectus carinatum or excavatum, scoliosis, and joint laxity. Affected children are usually hypotonic with delayed motor and speech development. Expressive language skills are more affected. A careful family history is important with emphasis on the presence of congenital heart disease, short stature or unusual facies among first-degree relatives.",

Most patients have more than one cardiac defect. Renal anomalies such as ectopic kidneys are present in 10% of cases. Fifty per cent of affected males have cryptorchidism with hypoplastic testes. There is an increased risk of the development of certain cancers because of gene mutations affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway, an important cell signalling pathway. These include neuroblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, low-grade glioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia and myeloproliferative disorders.

The diagnosis is based on findings in three fundamental areas: characteristic facial dysmorphology, growth retardation and CNS involvement. In addition to these three primary features, prenatal alcohol exposure impairs cardiogenesis and subsequently results in congenital heart disease occurring in about 40 to 54% of children diagnosed with FAS. The estimated global prevalence of FASD among the general population is 7.7 cases per 1,000 individuals.

Although its effect can affect every stage of pregnancy, the risk of facial anomalies and major structural anomalies occurs with exposure during the first trimester, with irreversible damage. The possible teratogenic effects depend on the timing, frequency, duration, amount of alcohol exposure as well as genetic susceptibility. Ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde can alter fetal development by disrupting cellular differentiation and growth, disrupting DNA and protein synthesis and inhibiting cell migration resulting in the various anomalies that can occur. The pathogenesis of congenital heart disease in FAS is not well known but it is hypothesised that fetal alcohol exposure has deleterious effects on the composition of the cardiac extracellular matrix or cardiac fibroblasts based on studies performed in animals (mice).\nAdditionally, prenatal alcohol exposure has been shown to impair cardiac development through numerous cellular mechanisms, including reduction of retinoic acid levels, apoptosis of neural crest cells, suppression of histone acetylation, and altered gene expression. Animal studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure can induce a range of abnormalities in heart structure and function, including thinning of the ventricular walls, decreased ejection fraction (EF), reduced heart weight, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Overt congenital heart defect phenotypes such as ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular canal malformation, cardiac chamber malformations, great vessel defects, and double outlet right ventricle have also been identified in animals.",

Three main genetic mechanisms are responsible for PWS:\n\nPaternal Deletion (about 70% of cases): A segment of the paternal chromosome 15 is deleted, preventing normal gene expression.\nMaternal Uniparental Disomy (UPD) (about 25% of cases): The individual inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother and none from the father.\nImprinting Defects (1-3% of cases): Errors in genomic imprinting prevent proper gene activation. The region affected includes genes responsible for hypothalamic regulation, which plays a significant role in developing key features of the syndrome.",

The P. falciparum causes most mortality from the disease. The geographic distribution of the species on the African continent is well described.(Poespoprodjo et al. 2023) The World Health Organization recognises malaria as an important disease affecting children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa and among the diseases contributing to the high under-five mortality.(World Health Organization 2023)",

Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Sudan and DRC are among the top 5 countries with the highest disease burdens. This is attributable to poverty, weak health systems and environmental conditions.(World Health Organization 2023)\nCountry: In Ghana, malaria is the third leading cause of under-5 morbidities and mortality. Pneumonia and diarrhoea account for the first and second causes of under-five morbidities. The disease is endemic in rural, overpopulated communities and slums.

Mono-therapy is NOT recommended in patients living in endemic and high-transmission settings. Treatment should be swift; therefore, home management of malaria is highly recommended.\nComplicated malaria: The aim of managing severe malaria is to prevent death and complications. Severe malaria can result in death within hours of progression from uncomplicated malaria to complicated. Prompt and swift response to clinical changes is paramount.\nThe WHO recommends parenteral artesunate and appropriate support care based on the clinical progression. Complicated malaria is a multi-system disease; therefore, clinicians should prioritise their care, emphasising supportive care. It is a medical emergency. Healthcare professionals should identify life-threatening situations like hypoglycaemia and hypoxaemia secondary to heart failure from complications such as severe anaemia and pulmonary oedema, convulsion and other central nervous manifestations from brain oedema and potentially raised intracranial pressure. Children can develop compensated and decompensated shock. When present, it should be corrected and monitored until the patient is stable.\nFull doses of parenteral artemisinin (artesunate or artemether) should be provided, followed by complete doses of ACT. Rectal Artesunate is recommended in situations where parenteral artemisinin is not available.\nParenteral artesunate: IV artesunate should be given immediately after malaria is confirmed at  2·4mg/kg per dose at 0, 12, and 24 hours, then every 24 hours till the child is stable and able to tolerate oral ACT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nChildren with body weight &lt;20 kg should receive 3·0 mg/kg per dose to ensure equivalent exposure to the drug.\n\n\nOther alternate medications are:\n\nIntramuscular artemether: initial dose 3·2 mg/kg, then 1·6 mg/kg every 24 h\nIntravenous quinine diluted in 5% dextrose: loading dose of 20 mg/kg infused over 4 hours, then 10 mg/kg every 8 hours infused no faster than 5 mg/kg per hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nQuinine is currently not recommended, and patients on Quinine are at risk of hypoglycaemia.\n\n\nPre-referral rectal artesunate: Recommended in primary health-care settings in which parenteral drug administration is not possible104\nChildren who are stable and can take oral medication should be given a full course of oral antimalarial treatment as per guidelines for uncomplicated malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution!\n\n\n\nDue to the risk of post-complicated malaria neurological syndrome.

    "section": "105.9 Case Discussion",
    "text": "105.9 Case Discussion\nThese reviews present four hypothetical case scenarios of severe malaria in children. It illustrates four key common pathways along which over 239,000 children die from malaria annually, either at rural health posts or in higher tertiary institutions across sub-Saharan Africa.\nCase 1: Malaria with Haemoglobinuria\nA 4-year-old girl was seen at a Community Health Provider Services (CHPS) compound with fever, vomiting and poor feeding. Clinical Care received at the CHPS compound included oral anti-malaria, antipyretic and haematinic drugs. The child’s condition worsened in the subsequent 24 hours with the passage of coca-cola-like urine, which the mother had noticed during the onset of the disease but not to the health worker at the CHPS.  The mother reported again to the CHPS compound the next day with the complaint of prostration and persistent fever. The child was subsequently referred to the primary health centre and, based on Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) criteria of classification of severe disease, the child was finally referred to the tertiary hospital as a case of severe malaria. The child convulsed on the way to the hospital and, upon arrival, was still having focal seizures. Blood glucose on admission was 1.2mmol/L, haemoglobin was 3.2g/dL, and lactate was 12.0mmol/L. Physical examination revealed a child in respiratory distress with deep breathing. The respiratory rate was 50 cycles per minute, and the heart rate was 146 beats per minute with weak volume. Chest auscultation revealed adequate air entry and clear lung fields. Extremities were cold with a capillary refill time of more than 4 sec.  Hypoglycaemia was immediately corrected with 10% dextrose, the shock was corrected with intravenous saline, and focal seizures were controlled with diazepam per rectum.  The Blantyre Coma Score subsequently improved from 0/5 to 2/5. The child was subsequently managed as cerebral malaria with severe anaemia secondary to haemoglobinuria, lactic acidosis, and shock. The child was noted to have scanty urine output (less than 0.3ml/kg/hour) on day 3 of admission.  BUN and creatinine were raised with normal serum electrolytes. Acute renal failure secondary to malaria with haemoglobinuria was diagnosed and managed accordingly with IV fluids and frusemide. The child had two episodes of blood transfusion during admission. She received quinine for seven days, and by day 5, she had regained consciousness and was walking by day 7. The child did not undergo dialysis but had complete recovery of renal function by day 14 of admission and was discharged home on day 15. She has remained well in subsequent reviews.\nCase 2: Malaria with Lactic Acidosis and Pulmonary Oedema\nA 4-year-old boy was referred to the paediatric emergency unit with a clinical diagnosis of severe malaria. He presented with prostration and deep breathing. The Chest X-ray showed pulmonary oedema.\nThe patient had earlier been seen at a health centre with a 2-day history of fever and vomiting, for which he received anti-malarial drugs (type unknown). The child’s condition did not improve as he continuously vomited the medications and was feeding poorly the following day. The mother noticed that the child’s condition had worsened with increasing breathlessness and inability to sit without support. The mother reported to the health post, and the child was immediately referred to the tertiary hospital.\nThe child arrived prostrated with acidotic deep breathing and had a respiratory rate of 66 cycles per minute. Air entry was adequate bilaterally, with crackles at the lung bases. Her heart rate was 148 beats/minute with normal heart sounds. There was no gallop rhythm. The child had no hepatomegaly but a splenomegaly of 6cm below the sub-coastal margin in the mid-clavicular line. The child was conscious with a Blantyre coma score of 5/5 but prostrated (unable to stand or sit without support). There were no other neurological deficits. Blood film comments revealed malaria parasitaemia (P. falciparum), haemoglobin was 5.2g/dl, lactic acid was 13.3mmol/L, and normal blood glucose was 4.7mmol/L. The child was subsequently managed as a case of severe malaria with lactic acidosis and pulmonary oedema (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS). The child was managed according to the WHO guidelines for the management of complicated malaria with IM quinine.\nCase 3: Cerebral Malaria with Raised Intracranial Pressure\nA 3-year-old boy developed a febrile illness in a rural community.  Mother gave acetaminophen at home with temporary relief of the fever. After 12 hours, the fever recurred with vomiting. A single episode of convulsion followed this. The child was sent to the health centre, where he was found to have gained consciousness and had no neurological deficit. The patient was managed as malaria with convulsion on oral anti-malaria drugs and sent home. When the parents got home, the child had another episode of convulsion, and the child was sent back to the health centre. The child was subsequently referred to the children’s emergency unit. The child arrived in the hospital with ongoing generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Random blood sugar was 1.2mmol/L, for which 5ml/kg of 10% dextrose was given immediately, and a maintenance glucose infusion was set up. Rectal diazepam was given to abort the seizures. Further examination revealed a deeply comatose child with a Blantyre Coma score of 0/5.  Oxygen saturation was 91%. The child had warm extremities, capillary refill time was less than 2 sec, and was clinically pale, not cyanosed and well hydrated. The respiratory rate was 62 cycles per minute, with occasional abnormal rhythm and effort.  The chest was clinically clear. Heart rate was 140 beats per minute with normal heart sounds. There was no hepato-splenomegaly. The child had increased tone, decorticate posture, increased reflexes and extensor plantar response. The pupil size was 1mm bilaterally and was non-responsive to light. The child was diagnosed to have cerebral malaria complicated by raised intracranial pressures. The patient was managed according to the WHO guideline for cerebral malaria, and the department treatment protocol-parenteral quinine was used.\nCase 4: Severe malaria with hyper-parasitemia and anaemia\nA 3-year-old child was referred to a tertiary hospital with a diagnosis of severe malaria with moderate anaemia. Examination findings revealed a child who was prostrated with normal blood glucose of 4.2 mmol/L, Haemoglobin of 6.5g/dl, and malaria parasite density of 679,234/uL.  The child was managed as severe malaria with moderate anaemia based on WHO guidelines and department protocol. A treatment course of parenteral quinine was given. After 22 hours, the child’s condition had worsened with an increase in respiratory rate from 42 cycles per minute to 66 cycles per minute. The child looked more prostrated with a Blantyre coma score of 2/5  (initial score of 4/5). The chest was clinically clear; the heart rate had increased from 126 to 160 beats per minute. Hepatomegaly had increased from 3cm to 6cm below the sub-cost margin in the mid-clavicular line. A repeat laboratory investigation revealed a haemoglobin drop to 4.5g/dL. The child was given packed red blood cells (20mL/kg BW) and further managed for malaria. The child responded to the treatment.\nDiscussions:\nIntroduction\nThe over 480,000 deaths from malaria recorded annually worldwide(Poespoprodjo et al. 2023) likely result from one of these case scenarios. One critical question researchers and clinicians should ask is: How can cases of malaria best be managed so that potentially complicated cases are identified early and appropriate measures are taken to avert death?\nToo many complicated malaria cases are seen across sub-Saharan Africa(World Health Organization 2023; K. Marsh et al. 1996).  As we advance in the knowledge of malaria pathogenesis and chemotherapy, we have to translate the research knowledge into good clinical practice and standard treatment. The case fatality rate from complicated malaria varies across Africa.(World Health Organization 2023) Competencies of health personnel in assessing children, among others, are important factors.  The bedside provides a good opportunity for health practitioners to pick up clinical clues that signal impending complications; if these clues are seen at the right time, appropriate management can be instituted early to avoid death. How can these clues be picked up to avoid these deaths in our health institutions across Africa? The WHO Handbook on Hospital Care for Children provides guidelines for assessing critically ill children.(Carter et al. 2011) This document should serve as training material and medical companion for lower-level health practitioners. Appropriate use of these materials at the lower level with the correct application of the IMCI modules should significantly impact the drive to reduce death from malaria.(de Mendonça, Goncalves, and Barral-Netto 2012)\nReview of cases\nCase 1: In this case scenario, a history of the passage of dark-coloured urine was enough to suspect haemolysis in this child. If this essential symptom had been picked at the child’s first appearance at the CHPS, it should have led to an immediate referral to a higher health centre. \nThe passage of dark-coloured urine (haemoglobinuria) is a recognised complication of severe malaria.(Crawley and Nahlen 2004; Crawley et al. 2010) Any child who presents with such symptoms is at risk of two potentially fatal complications: severe anaemia and acute renal failure from pigment nephropathy. Such cases should be referred to a centre where facilities for safe blood transfusion exist. Acute renal failure from haemoglobinuria usually responds to fluid therapy (approx 1.5 times maintenance fluid, oral or intravenous). Haemoglobinuria is recognised as an important cause of acute renal failure in children.(World Health Organization 2024) The case under discussion presented haemoglobinuria followed by the two complications of severe anaemia and acute renal failure. The swift institution of haemotransfusion therapy averted death. Her renal failure responded to conservative treatment with IV fluid and frusemide with careful monitoring of the lung bases for any evidence of pulmonary congestion.  It is important to note that primary-level health facilities across Africa will not be privileged to have facilities to measure the haemoglobin levels of children reporting severe malaria. However, a simple examination of the conjunctiva, palms and soles by these first-level healthcare workers can detect significant anaemia in children. Similarly, enquiry about urine colour or macroscopic inspection of a urine sample could indicate haemolysis that requires prompt review or referral. The scientific knowledge about the pathogenesis of malaria-induced anaemia is widely known, and the bedside clinical recognition of severe anaemia that is critical to warrant transfusion is clear.(World Health Organization 2024) The current challenge in most sub-Saharan African countries is recognising potentially complicated malaria cases before the complications manifest themselves. Healthcare professionals across sub-Saharan Africa should continuously train and develop their skills in identifying the early signs and symptoms of severe malaria.\nCase 2: Prostration is a common presentation in children with severe malaria and an important triage finding that health workers should not miss in both the peripheral centres and the tertiary health institutions. It is one clue that does not rely on any laboratory or specialised care to detect. Recognising prostration does not require extraordinary skills. Prostration is clearly defined as a criterion for severe and complicated malaria; missing prostration could lead to an underestimation of the disease condition and a serious delay in treatment. In the case under discussion, the prostration was correctly recognised by the healthcare worker at the periphery, which prompted the referral.  Clinicians in sub-Saharan Africa should develop the skill and the consciousness to evaluate every child for prostration at the first point of contact. Prostration in younger children who are yet to sit can be difficult to assess. The inability to suckle or drink should raise suspicion.\nEarly diagnosis of pulmonary complications is key to survival. A higher respiratory rate, lower chest wall in-drawing and recessions may be key findings in recognising pulmonary complications. Counting respiratory rates accurately over one minute and relating them to other clinical signs and symptoms is the simplest way of determining children who are critically ill from malaria with possible pulmonary complications.\nCase 3: This patient would have died from Hypoglycaemia, Respiratory Arrest secondary to raised intracranial pressure or other complications of cerebral malaria. In low-level health settings across sub-Saharan Africa, glucose measurement is not routinely done. However, a history of poor feeding and or vomiting in the presence of prostration and unconsciousness should prompt health workers about the possibility of hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia secondary to malaria is known to be associated with very high mortality.(World Health Organization 2023) Management of the condition is simple and cheap.  In advanced cases of severe malaria where there has been the involvement of the brain, raised intracranial pressures ensue. Failure to recognise this life-threatening complication eventually leads to respiration arrest and eventual death. Early clues known from scientific knowledge should be applied at the bedside. Abnormal respiratory patterns, deep breathing without blood gases and electrolytes, abnormal postures, and pupillary changes are the bedside clinical signs of potential raised intracranial pressure.\nCase 4:  Early clinical signs in a child with severe malaria and hyperparasitaemia can be misleading, especially if health staff do not have much experience in monitoring the clinical signs of deterioration.  The progression of clinical disease and the care available determine whether the child would survive severe malaria. In the presence of heavy parasitaemia, health practitioners should be aware that even moderate anaemia could rapidly lead to severe anaemia, which could subsequently lead to heart failure. All parasitised red cells will eventually haemolyse in the spleen and other reticuloendothelial systems. In addition, because of the rosette formation, all the red cells pulled into the spleen will be haemolysed. Children with acute malaria, therefore, rapidly develop severe anaemia, and clinical teams should have a high index of suspicion as well as prepare to administer blood transfusion whenever the need arises.  The majority of the over one million malarial deaths that occur annually do occur because of the complications associated with the disease. Prompt recognition of these complications at all levels of health care and well-established referral systems will go a long way in reducing these deaths. No death was recorded among these four cases that presented multiple complications associated with severe malaria. Sub-Saharan Africa’s challenge is translating the numerous research findings conducted in Africa into good clinical practice. \nOverall Comment:\nBasic clinical indices that are well known to signify impending complication or life-threatening malaria should be applied in triaging and reassessing all children who present with malaria. From the health centre to the tertiary hospital, these clinical indices can guide health officials in managing children according to standard protocols and guidelines, thus avoiding death from complicated malaria.\n\n\n\n\nCarter, Nick, Allan Pamba, Stephan Duparc, and John N Waitumbi. 2011. “Frequency of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency in Malaria Patients from Six African Countries Enrolled in Two Randomized Anti-Malarial Clinical Trials.” Malaria Journal 10 (1). https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-10-241.\n\n\nCrawley, Jane, Cindy Chu, George Mtove, and François Nosten. 2010. “Malaria in Children.” The Lancet 375 (9724): 1468–81. https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60447-3.\n\n\nCrawley, Jane, and Bernard Nahlen. 2004. “Prevention and Treatment of Malaria in Young African Children.” Seminars in Pediatric Infectious Diseases 15 (3): 169–80. https://doi.org/10.1053/j.spid.2004.05.009.\n\n\nde Mendonça, Vitor R.

Some traditional beliefs can interfere with timely medical intervention.\n\n109.7.1 Common Traditional Concepts\n\n‘Asram’: A broad term referring to various childhood illnesses believed to be caused spiritually or through a ‘bad eye’.\nPractices such as squeezing the newborn’s breast to treat engorgement or forcing cord separation can be harmful.\nOther practices like head moulding and the use of herbal amulets may be harmless.\nThere are beneficial traditional practices, such as giving newly delivered mothers extra food or the wearing of beads, that help monitor the baby’s growth.\n\nHealthcare providers must acknowledge these beliefs while gently guiding families toward evidence-based practices. Understanding and respecting cultural perspectives can help bridge communication gaps and improve health outcomes.",

Accurate social history-taking, sensitivity to cultural practices, and awareness of legal mandates empower medical practitioners to advocate effectively for their young patients. Collaborative efforts with social workers, educators, and legal authorities may be necessary to address complex challenges.",
