    "text": "23.3 Ways of measuring BP\n\nDirect intra-arterial measurements by placing a catheter into the vessel and measuring the pressure “in line” with the vessel (end-on-pressure). This method is used by physiologists and Intensivists. The principle is employed in the measurements of central venous pressure (CVP) & intracranial pressure (ICP) in clinical practice.\nAuscultatory method with the use of a sphygmomanometer (either mercury or arenoid) and a stethoscope. This is the gold standard in clinical practice. K1 & K5 sounds are measured for systolic & diastolic pressures respectively. Values obtained are generally lower than direct & oscillometric measurements.\nPalpation method (flush technique) with the use of a sphygmomanometer and palpating finger. Largely unreliable. Only systolic BP can be measured with this technique. The palpated pulse is generally lower than K1 by 10mmHg.\nThe oscillometric method uses a sphygmomanometer and a monitor e.g. digital BP devices & data map. Here, pulsatile blood flow through arterial wall oscillations is transmitted to the cuff encircling the extremity. K1 is recorded at the point of rapid increase in oscillation amplitude. K5 is recorded as the point of a sudden decrease in oscillation amplitude. Values obtained by oscillometric measurements are generally higher than auscultatory.\nDoppler ultrasound technique: Here a Doppler ultrasound is held over the pulse to magnify the sound so that it is audible without a stethoscope. The sound detected may be 5mmHg higher than K1.\nAmbulatory BP measurements. Here, multiple measurements are recorded over time (e.g. 24 hours) with digital devices attached to the limb whilst the patient engages in normal activities outside the hospital. Results are analysed on a computer or paper tracer built into the device using the mean of the readings. It provides a truer picture of BP trends Useful in diagnosing “white coat hypertension” and nocturnal hypertension (absence of a normal physiological drop in BP during sleep)."

The inability of cerebral vasculature to constrict appropriately in response to the abrupt increase in cerebral blood flow leads to cerebral hyperperfusion. Generally, short-acting antihypertensives are preferred in the initial instance of treatment so that any potentially harmful drop in blood pressure (which could lead to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome {PRES}) could be reversed. Subsequently, long-acting agents could be used Sublingual nifedipine could cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure so it is best avoided or should be used with extreme caution\nTreatment outline:\n\nUse Ianti-hypertensive drugs\nBlood pressure should be brought down slowly to a desirable level (?stage I)by 48hrs (though not to normal levels) as follows:\n\n1/3 of total blood pressure reduction in 1st 12-hrs\nNext one-third of the subsequent 12-hrs\nFinal one-third over 24-hrs\n\nAlternatively, by a quarter within 6 hours, and the rest in the next 24-36hrs\n\nCommon preferred drugs:\n- Labetalol infusion\n- Na nitroprusside infusion - IV hydrallazine infusion\nAfter achieving the desired blood pressure target, oral antihypertensives are then started"
