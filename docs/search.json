    "text": "Preface\nMedical knowledge has evolved tremendously over the past century. With the advent of the internet, sharing medical knowledge has become very easy. However, most medical literature available originates from developed countries, thus devoid of the relevant local content for many underdeveloped regions. This is critical for medical education and practice in that these texts often do not consider the cultural relevance of these pathologies, disease patterns and risks, local treatment options and idiosyncrasies of the medical delivery systems. Undoubtedly, these have significant effects on medical education and practice.\nThis text was birthed out of the need to bridge this gap. Though the content is primarily directed at undergraduate medical teaching, it can be beneficial to postgraduate trainees as well.",

If the stress has been going on for a while and the fetus has been passing meconium for a few days, the cord, skin and nails may be stained. Occurs when the fetus passes meconium into the surrounding liquor and then aspirates this into the lungs. Tends to happen in term and post-date babies. Distressed fetuses tend to pass meconium either just before or during the delivery process. The smaller the amniotic fluid volume, and the more meconium the baby passes, the thicker the fluid and the more dangerous it becomes if aspirated.\nHistory of Pregnancy and delivery looking for predisposing factors such as fetal distress, post-maturity, meconium-stained liquor etc. Physical examination looking for signs of meconium-staining on the baby, and evidence of respiratory distress (fast breathing, chest indrawing, cyanosis etc.). Investigations include FBC, Blood C&S, and sometimes a chest X-ray depending on the severity. Management is mainly supportive. Includes antibiotics, respiratory support, supportive treatment, IVFs and nutrition.\n\n\n7.8.2 Transient tachypnoea of the newborn\nCaused by delay in clearance of fetal lung fluid.

A complete history may unmask the likely cause of symptoms and guide further questioning, for example, sepsis.\nExamination on the other hand involves assessing the Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Random Blood Sugar, provision of Oxygen and checking Oxygen saturation. This can be pre- and post-ductal. Others include temperature checks and other vital signs. The weight, current weight, head circumference, and length.

Surfactants are essential for reducing the surface area of the lungs, thus helping in breathing. Incidence and severity increase with decreasing gestational age. Other risk factors include prematurity, male gender, multiple gestations, being born to a mother with diabetes mellitus and hypothermia. Signs of RDS include tachypnea, grunting, recessions and cyanosis. Prevention involves preventing preterm births and administering corticosteroids to the mother of gestation between 24 to 34 weeks before delivery. Treatment however involves the administration of surfactant.\nNote that this condition is different from Respiratory Distress in a newborn. Respiratory distress is a more generalised term used as a single or a combination of signs as a result of increased work of breathing. It can result from pulmonary as well as non-pulmonary causes. These include cardiac, neurological (eg. Asphyxia), haematological (Anemia) and sepsis. It occurs in both term and preterm children.",

In the newborn period, it is defined as a random blood glucose of &lt; 2.6mmol/l. Risk factors include sepsis, Infant of a diabetic mother, prematurity, Intrauterine growth restriction, birth asphyxia and hypothermia. Signs include Lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, and apnea. Neurological damage may result from hypoglycemia in neonates.\nNeonatal hypoglycemia is most commonly seen in macrosomic infants and infants of diabetic mothers. For these babies, during pregnancy, maternal glucose crosses the placenta to cause fetal hyperglycaemia. The fetal pancreas responds by increasing insulin production. Following delivery, the hyperglycaemic stimulus is instantly removed but insulin production may take longer to slow down. This results in an increased risk and incidence of hypoglycemia at the early newborn period.\nManagement involves initially checking the airway, breathing and circulation. 2ml/kg of IV 10% Dextrose or 5ml/kg of 5% Dextrose may be given PR if IV access is unavailable. Ensure the baby has a normal body temperature (temperature target: 36.50 – 37.50C) as hypothermia prone the baby to hypoglycaemia. Always look for the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia and treat it appropriately.",

    "text": "8.6 Neonatal Sepsis\nSepsis in the neonate kills more than a million babies worldwide every year. It is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs of infection with accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life. It can be categorized into Early Onset Neonatal Sepsis (EOS), which refers to the presence of signs of infection accompanied by a positive culture within the first 72 hours of life, and Late Onset Neonatal Sepsis (LOS), which signifies the onset of signs of infection with a positive culture after 72 hours of life.\nCausative organisms: Early-onset sepsis is typically caused by organisms from the maternal genital tract, whereas late-onset sepsis is caused by organisms in the caregiving environment or community. Common organisms are Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus among others. For many of these organisms, the resistance rate to antibiotics is alarmingly going up.\nAntenal risk factors known to be associated with neonatal jaundice include spontaneous rupture of membranes, less than 37 completed weeks of gestation, spontaneous preterm labour, rupture of membranes greater than 18 hours before delivery, maternal chorioamnionitis, maternal fever of 38 degrees Celsius or more, maternal invasive bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, pre-labour rupture of membranes, Group B Streptococcus infection in a previous baby, or current pregnancy, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and foul-smelling liquor.\nPostnatally, risk factors for neonatal sepsis include prolonged resuscitation at birth, prematurity, invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation, excessive handling, home delivery, lack of hand washing and inadequate Infection prevention control. Others include overcrowding and prolonged hospital stay.\nSigns of neonatal sepsis include\n\nAbnormal colour: Pale, cyanotic, mottled appearance, jaundice, grey\nTemperature instability\nAbdominal signs: distension, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhoea\nRespiratory: Apnea, respiratory distress, gasping (Abnormal breathing)\nHypo - or hyperglycemia\nCardiovascular: Shock, tachycardia (HR &gt; 180), Bradycardia (HR &lt; 80)\nAbnormal bleeding\nCentral Nervous System: Excessive crying, irritability, seizures, altered tone, lethargy,\n\nManagement of neonatal sepsis should be comprehensive. It should include an initial evaluation for resuscitation of the airway, breathing and circulation. Further, the blood sugar should be measured. Early reversal of the shock state by administering an initial bolus of 10ml/kg of crystalloid or its equivalent should be done in the shock present. Vasopressors or inotropes should be used in septic shock only after appropriate volume resuscitation has been done. The goals of the resuscitation should be Normal Cap refill (less than 2 seconds), normal pulses, warm extremities, and appropriate urine output (greater than 1mL/kg/hr).\nIncreased successful treatment of neonatal sepsis requires early recognition and urgent administration of appropriate antibiotics.\nAfter resuscitation, ongoing management usually starts with a detailed history to assess risk factors and other presentations. A thorough physical examination will then be performed, looking for and documenting specific signs indicating severity.\nInvestigations usually include a blood culture. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Ideally, a culture should always be done before the first dose of antibiotics. Other auxiliary investigations include a complete blood count, blood gases, urine culture, and a lumbar puncture. The threshold for performing a lumber puncture in all symptomatic newborns suspected of sepsis should be encouraged. It should however be deferred in neonates considered too unstable to tolerate the procedure, or where there is an absolute contraindication.\nSupportive treatment is essential for a good outcome in neonatal sepsis. Antibiotics are not the entire solution to their treatment. Nutrition or breastfeeding should be optimized. The environment should be thermo-neutral and oxygen saturation should be maintained within the normal range (89 – 95%). Intravenous fluids should be used if the infant is hemodynamically unstable. Monitoring of the blood glucose levels should be instituted. Packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma should be used in the event of anaemia or bleeding.",

Universally accepted as one of the commonest causes of admission and readmission in the first month of life. At Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital Mother Baby Unit, monthly admissions average between 300 and 400 and about 15 to 25% of all these admissions are cases of neonatal jaundice. Whereas the developed world describes kernicterus as a rare condition, unfortunately, the same cannot be said for us in developing countries. On average, cases of severe Neonatal Jaundice have ranged from 2.2% to 30.8% of all jaundice cases, with the monthly mortality ranging from 2.8% to 15.2%(REFERENCE).

For every gram of haemoglobin, 35mg of bilirubin is produced. The bilirubin is conjugated by the UGT enzyme, making it water-soluble, which is then released into the bile before being excreted in the stool (and urine). It can also be broken down in the intestine by bacterial enzymes like E. coli. However, at birth, the newborn has several challenges. The liver is immature, and the levels of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) enzyme are low. Newborns have β-glucuronidase in the intestinal mucosa/brush border, which deconjugates the conjugated bilirubin found in the meconium. The unconjugated bilirubin can now be reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and recycled back into the circulation. This process is known as the “enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin”. The gut is sterile and, subsequently, infants have far fewer bacteria in the gut, and so very little, if any, bilirubin is reduced to urobilin and stercobilin.\nSpecifically in newborns, more bilirubin is produced, on account of the short life span of Red Blood Cells and high Hemoglobin levels. The liver is immature. They also have fewer bacteria and low intestinal enzymatic activity in the intestine",

    "section": "9.4 Types of Jaundice",
    "text": "9.4 Types of Jaundice\nThere are two main types of jaundice:\n\n\nPhysiological jaundice and\nPathological jaundice.\n\nThere are three main mechanisms for jaundice:\n\n\nIncreased bilirubin production\nDecreased bilirubin clearance and\nIncreased enterohepatic circulation.\n\n\n9.4.1 Physiological jaundice\n\n9.4.1.1 Increased bilirubin production\nin term newborn infants, bilirubin production is 2 to 3 times higher than in adults. This occurs because newborns have more RBCs and fetal RBCs have a shorter life span than those in adults. Unfortunately, the liver being immature, cannot conjugate and excrete all the bilirubin from the breakdown of all the excess RBCs, thereby resulting in spillover of bilirubin into the blood.\n\n\n9.4.1.2 Bilirubin clearance or excretion\nThis is decreased in newborns, mainly due to the low levels of the UGT enzyme in the liver. UGT activity in term infants at day 7 of age is approximately 1% of that of the adult liver and does not reach adult levels until about 14 weeks of age.\n\n\n9.4.1.3 Enterohepatic circulation\nThe presence of the ß-glucuronidase results in an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, further increasing the bilirubin load in the infant. This is a diagnosis of exclusion\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Pathological jaundice\n\n9.4.2.1 Definition\nNeonatal jaundice is said to be pathologic if:\n\nJaundice in the 1st 24 - 48 hours of life.\nRate of SB rise &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (8.5µmol/L) per hour\nJaundice all over the body (including palms & soles)\nPresence of a danger sign\nHistory of previous siblings having had jaundice at birth\nJaundice in a term newborn after 2 weeks of age or in a preterm infant after 3 weeks of age\nDirect (conjugated) bilirubin concentration &gt; 20% of the total\n\nIt can be caused by certain pathologic conditions or exaggeration of the mechanisms responsible for physiologic neonatal jaundice. Identification of what is causing the jaundice is useful in guiding management, including counselling of the parents and what to expect for the next pregnancy. Most common cause is increased bilirubin production due to haemolytic disease processes that include the following:\n\nIsoimmune-mediated haemolysis (e.g., ABO or Rhesus D incompatibility)\nErythrocyte enzymatic defects, e.g. G6PD deficiency\nSepsis, especially Urinary Tract Infection\nPolycythaemia\nBirth Injuries resulting in sequestration of blood within a closed space, e.g. cephalohematoma, subgaleal bleed.\n\n\n\n9.4.2.2 ABO incompatibility\nThis is one of the most common causes of isoimmune hemolytic disease during the neonatal period. Infants with blood group A or B, carried by blood group O mother, will have a positive antibody because of maternal anti-A or anti-B transfer into the fetal circulation.\n\n\n9.4.2.3 Rhesus Incompatibility\nRh incompatibility can occur when an Rh-negative pregnant mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells secondary to feto-maternal haemorrhage during pregnancy/delivery. As a result, the mother’s blood gets exposed to the fetal circulation and sensitization occurs leading to maternal antibody production against the foreign Rh antigen. Once produced, maternal Rh (IgG) antibodies may cross freely from the placenta to the fetal circulation, where they form antigen-antibody complexes with Rh- positive fetal RBCs and eventually are destroyed, resulting in a fetal alloimmune-induced hemolytic anaemia and jaundice. The first pregnancy is usually not affected, but more antibodies are produced with each pregnancy making the jaundice worse with each pregnancy.\n\n\n9.4.2.4 Decreased clearance\nInherited defects in the gene that encodes the UGT liver enzyme (eg, Gilbert Syndrome), decrease bilirubin conjugation (eg Crigglar Najjar). In physiological jaundice, the levels are naturally low, but here, in addition to the low levels the UGT enzyme is either defective, absent or has a reduced function. This reduces hepatic bilirubin metabolism and its clearance thereby increasing the total serum unconjugated bilirubin levels.\n\n\n9.4.2.5 Increased enterohepatic circulation\nThe major causes are\n\n\nBreastfeeding jaundice\nBreast milk jaundice\nImpaired intestinal motility is caused by functional or anatomic obstruction.\nCongenital hypothyroidism also causes increased enterohepatic circulation on account of reduced gut motility.",

The dose in turn is determined by:\n\nThe wavelength of the light\nThe intensity of the light (irradiance)\nThe distance between the light and the baby\nThe body’s surface area is exposed to the light.\n\nEffective phototherapy lowers serum bilirubin levels by converting the lipid-soluble bilirubin into water-soluble forms that can easily be excreted in the stool and urine Phototherapy also prevents the need for an Exchange Blood Transfusion and prevents bilirubin from depositing in the brain. The breakdown of bilirubin begins almost instantaneously when the skin is exposed to light, hence, phototherapy should be started as early as possible.\nIn initiating phototherapy, always note the time the baby’s SBR sample is being taken and estimate the age in hours up until that time. Interpret bilirubin levels according to the baby’s postnatal age in hours and manage the bilirubin levels according to the threshold table Start phototherapy if the SBR plots on or above the line appropriate for age (in hours) and gestational age If the SBR plots just underneath the line, repeat the SBR after 6 hours or start phototherapy if a repeat is not feasible. Repeat the SBR at least 24 to 48 hours after initiation of phototherapy. Discontinue phototherapy when the SBR plots below the line.\nThe side effects of phototherapy include:\n\nIncrease insensible water loss\nLoose stools\nSkin rash\nBronze baby syndrome\nHypo- or Hyperthermia\nInterruption of mother-baby bonding\n\n\n\n9.7.3 Sunlight Therapy\nWorks for physiological jaundice, however, one can never tell by looking at a baby what kind of jaundice a baby has Err on the side of caution, at least always have the SBR checked first Remember prolonged exposure to UV rays can be harmful to the developing skin Baby cannot be put in the light for more than 30 minutes in a day Even most of the available literature and studies that recommend sunlight still advice that if the jaundice is severe, the baby must be managed in the hospital!! A serum bilirubin high enough to warrant treatment should be managed in the hospital.\n\n\n9.7.4 Exchange Blood Transfusion\nProvides a means of rapid reduction of circulating bilirubin in the blood. Involves manual removal of the baby’s blood and simultaneously replacing it with compatible donor blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Exchange Blood Transfusion\n\n\n\nIn addition to reducing bilirubin levels, EBT removes partially hemolyzed RBCs, RBCs coated with antibodies and circulating immunoglobulins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Bilirubin Graph (&gt; 38 weeks)\n\n\n\nComplications of exchange blood transfusion include:\n\nCardiac & respiratory disorders\nShock due to bleeding or inadequate replacement of blood infection\nCatheter-related complications\nChanges in the composition of the blood (high or low potassium, low calcium, low glucose, changes in pH)\nThrombocytopenia\nAnd the rare but serious complications of air embolism, portal hypertension, and necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\n\n\n9.7.5 Intravenous Immunoglobins\nTreatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been suggested as an alternative therapy to Exchange Blood Transfusion for isoimmune hemolytic jaundice to reduce the need for Exchange Blood Transfusion and duration of phototherapy and hospitalization in isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn. It has been proposed that IVIG blocks the binding of the antibody to the antigen. With this blockade, hemolysis no longer occurs.",

The arterial supply of the heart is through the coronary arteries while venous drainage is through the coronary sinus. The aorta and pulmonary arteries arise from the left and right ventricles. The heart has three layers:\nVenous blood enters the right atrium through the inferior and superior vena cavae. It empties in atrial systole into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. It then moves on through the pulmonary valve in ventricular systole, to the pulmonary artery and then the lungs. Blood returning from the lungs enters the left atrium through the four pulmonary veins. In atrial systole, it moves into the left ventricle through the mitral valve.

Also, both systolic and diastolic pressures in the aorta are higher than that in the pulmonary artery.\nSystolic pressure in general is generated by the ventricles. In conditions such as coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, the ventricles increase their workload to generate enough pressure.

These are adaptations to using the placenta rather than the lungs for oxygenation. These shunts are the ductus venosus, ductus arteriosus and patent foramen. At birth, these shunts regress. The ductus venosus regresses quickly to form the ligamentum arteriosus. The foramen ovale closes at birth physiologically but may take years to close anatomically. The patent ductus arteriosus closes soon after birth but can physiologically stay open for 72 hours. Beyond this period it is considered to be pathologic if it continues to stay open. Patent ductus arteriosus are quite common in preterm newborns.",

It is further divided into:\n\nAcyanotic: These are congenital heart diseases that are traditionally not known to be associated with cyanosis. Examples include ventricular septal defect (VSD), Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)\nCyanotic: These on the other hand are associated with cyanosis and include Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), Truncus Arteriosus and Tricuspid Atresia.\n\nAcquired heart disorders: These are heart conditions that are not present at birth but develop afterwards. They include Infective Endocarditis (IE), Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and Endomyocardial Fibrosis (EMF)\nRhythm disorders: This set of disorders can present as either congenital or acquired. They affect the electrical system of the heart leading to an increase in heart rate (tachyarrhythmia), decrease in heart rate (bradyarrhythmia) or even normal heart rate.\nSecondary cardiac disorders: Some pathologies tend to affect the heart as a complication. Such conditions include some glycogen storage disorders resulting in cardiomyopathy and Rheumatoid arthritis resulting in pericardial effusion.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "20.1.1 Prenatal\nPrenatally, the history should delve into but not be limited to the following:\n\nInfections: Some infections are the well-known TORCHES. They include Toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, parvovirus B19 (fifth disease), varicella (chickenpox) and (Zika), Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus. Rubella when acquired in the first trimester of pregnancy is very well known to be associated with PDAs.\nMedications: The use of some medications, including herbs predisposes to heart disease in newborns. Anticonvulsant such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are highly teratogenic.(Kalisch-Smith, Ved, and Sparrow 2019)\nRecreational drugs: Excessive smoking, cocaine, and alcohol use in early pregnancy are all associated with teratogenic effects on the heart.\nMaternal illnesses: Maternal medical conditions during pregnancy may be associated with heart diseases in their fetuses. Diabetes mellitus is particularly well known, predisposing to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, d-Transposition of the Great Arteries, etc. Autoimmune conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus may also predispose to rhythm disturbances in the fetus and child, even when the mother is not symptomatic.\nFamily history of CHD: The recurrence of CHD in first-degree relatives varies but is almost always higher than in the rest of the population. For instance, having a first-degree relation with a cornoventricular defect is associated with a recurrence risk ratio of 24.3 (95% CI,12.2 to 48.7), 7.1 (95% CI, 4.5 to 11.1) for isolated Atrial Septal Defect, and 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.3) for isolated Ventricular Septal Defect.(Øyen et al. 2009)\n\n\n\n20.1.2 Perinatal\nPerinatal history associated with heart disease may include the following:\n\nBirth weight: A high birth weight, often associated with a child of a diabetic mother is also associated with an increased incidence of CHDs. Conversely, a low birth weight may also be associated with fetal alcohol syndrome or congenital rubella syndrome, both of which are associated with CHDs.\nNewborn resuscitation: Some critical CHDs can be similar to neonatal asphyxia in a newborn, thus requiring resuscitation.\n\n\n\n20.1.3 After birth\nAscertaining history after birth is the most extensive. Many of these are directed to the features of heart failure. These include:\n\nGrowth failure: Poor weight gain is a very prominent feature of CHDs in children. Many clinically significant CHDs result in poor feeding, chronic metabolic demand on the patient and poor oxygenation in cyanotic CHDs. All these result in increased caloric demand, resulting in poor growth.\nCyanotic spells: Some cyanotic CHDs are associated with recurrent periods where the child has increasing cyanosis, sometimes associated with weakness, fast breathing and even unconsciousness. The presence of these spells may be a pointer to a CHD.\nSquatting and exercise intolerance: Exercise intolerance is a common presentation of heart disease in children. However, for some cyanotic congenital heart diseases, most notably Tetralogy of Fallot, the added feature is frequent squatting when the child becomes fatigued.\nDelayed milestones: Growth failure, easy fatiguability and other genetic syndromes may result in delayed motor milestones in the child.\nOthers: Fast and sometimes difficulty breathing are also common presentations of CHDs. Some children develop oedema.(Figure 20.1) This is predominantly seen in the faces of younger children and the feet of older children. Frequent lower respiratory infection is also seen in children with heart diseases, especially those associated with heart failure.\nUncommon symptoms: Uncommon presentation of heart disease in children include:\n\nChest pain is a rather feared symptom in adults but usually portends another diagnosis rather than heart disease in children.\nSyncope can be observed in children with an arrhythmia, or left or right ventricular obstruction. However, this is still not a common presentation in pediatric heart diseases.\nOlder children report palpitations.\nJoint swelling does occur in Rheumatic Heart Disease but again not a common presentation in children with heart pathology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.1: Pedal oedema in a child with heart failure",

One should first look out for life-threatening signs and intervene quickly. Subsequent steps could include:\n\nNutritional status is very important as many children with chronic heart conditions with significant heart failure present with malnutrition. The growth pattern of the patient should always be evaluated.\nDysmorphism is very critical in pediatric heart diseases. As much as 23% of all children with CHD will have a chromosomal abnormality.(Wang et al. 2023) There are many genetic syndromes with well-documented recognisable heart defects. Below are just a few adapted from Ko (2015):\n\nCommon genetic syndromes associated with congenital heart diseases\n\n\nGenetic syndrome\n% with CHD\nCardiac anomalies\n\n\n\n\nDown Syndrome\n40 to 50\nAtrial Septal Defect, Ventricular Septal Defect, Atrioventricular Canal Defect, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n\nTurner’s syndrome\n25 to 45\nCoarctation of the Aorta.

Cyanosis, the blueish duskiness of the skin and mucous membranes can be seen in children with a cyanotic congenital heart disease. In black skin, this may be difficult and can only be observed in the mouth and tongue (Figure 20.2). Mild cyanosis is often not visible and may require the use of pulse oximetry. Pallor can be observed in patients with heart diseases, such as Infective Endocarditis. Jaundice can be observed in patients with Infective Endocarditis or those with hepatic injury secondary to chronic heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.2: Cyanosis in the tongue of a child\n\n\n\n\nClubbing: All four stages of digital clubbing are seen in children with cyanotic CHD or Infective Endocarditis. (Figure 20.3) Note that some cases of finger clubbing may be familial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.3: Finger clubbing\n\n\n\n\nRespiratory signs: Respiratory signs commonly associated with heart diseases in children are tachypnoea, dyspnoea, chest recessions and increased work of breathing. These are especially true when there is associated heart failure and worsens with exercise or breastfeeding infants.\nCirculation: The circulation in a child with a suspected heart disease is critical. Reduced circulation can be assessed with the warmth of the extremities, capillary refill time, and blood pressure.\nBlood pressure: Low blood pressure is a late sign of circulatory failure and cardiogenic shock. Conversely, weak pulse may be associated with hypertensive heart disease as well. Wide pulse pressure, an abnormally wide difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures may indicate a patent ductus arteriosus, aortic insufficiency or an aorticopulmonary window. Blood pressure should be checked in the upper and lower limbs as a higher BP in the upper limbs compared to the lower may indicate the presence of a Coarctation of the Aorta.\nPulses: The radial pulse is the most routinely examined in cardiovascular examination. It should be checked for the rate, rhythm, volume and character. If they are difficult to examine, especially in young infants, the brachial pulsus can be used. Other pulses should be examined and they include the brachial pulses, femoral and dorsalis pedis. Next, synchronization of the radio-femoral pulse should be determined for a delay. This happens in the coarctation of the aorta. Pulses difficult to palpate or inconsistent could be caused by large artery arteritis such as Taksyasu’s arteritis.\n\n\n\n20.2.2 Precordial\n\nInspection: Inspection of the precordium yields a wealth of information in a child with a suspected heart disease. A midline bulge or left-sided bulge will often indicate a right or left-sided heart chamber dilatation. Visible precordial pulsation should be noted. Scars, especially from previous surgeries are useful. Scarification, the usually small “medicinal” scars done on the chest as a means of treatment should also be noted. A Harrison sulcus, depression of the lower part of the chest is common in children with chronic heart failure and thus dyspnoea. Figure 20.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.4: Chest bulge and Harrison’s sulcus in child\n\n\n\n\nPalpation: Palpation should be directed toward determining the presence of a thrill (a palpable murmur), heave at the apex or middle of the precordium. Also, a palpable heart sound, especially the second at the upper left sternal edge may indicate pulmonary hypertension.\nPercussion: This is of very little relevance in the examination of the heart in children.\nAuscultation: Auscultation of the heart can yield a wealth of information. It should be done in a quiet environment, with the child as calm as possible. Auscultating can be performed with both bell and diaphragm. All four auscultatory areas need to be auscultated. It is always prudent to auscultate the back (between the scapulae) and over the carotids. First, the regular two heart sounds should be determined. If muffled, they could indicate a pericardial effusion or sometimes obesity. Pulmonary hypertension and an Atrial Septal Defect for instance could result in a loud or split second heart sound. The presence of a third heart sound (S3) is not always pathologic in children but an S4 is. The presence of a murmur needs to be determined. If present, it should be determined if it is systolic or diastolic, and the point of maximal intensity. It needs to be graded (Table 20.1) and the presence of radiation ascertained. Table 20.2 indicates types of murmurs, their location and likely heart diseases. Diastolic murmurs are difficult to appreciate for the average medical student but may be present in aortic regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation, and at the cardiac apex in cases of heart failure secondary to a large left-to-right shunt. It is of note that approximately 80% of murmurs in children can be categorised as “innocent murmurs” as they are not associated with cardiac pathology.\nOther sounds need to be evaluated as well. These may include a pericardial rub which occurs in pericarditis, an ejection click heart in early systole and cases of aortic or pulmonary stenosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 20.1: Grades of murmurs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGrade I\nBarely perceptible\n\n\nGrade II\nSoft, but easily audible\n\n\nGrade III\nModerately loud but has not thrill\n\n\nGrade IV\nLoud and associated with a thrill\n\n\nGrade V\nAudible with stethoscope partially of the chest\n\n\nGrade VI\nAudible with stethoscope off the chest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 20.2: Heart diseases and their murmur characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurmur\nLocation\nCondition\n\n\n\n\nPansystolic\nLLSB\nVSD, Tricuspid regurgitation\n\n\nPansystolic\nApex\nRheumatic Heart Disease, Mitral valve prolapse\n\n\nEjection systolic\nURSB\nAortic stenosis\n\n\nEjection systolic\nULSB\nASD, Pulmonary stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot, Coarctation of the aorta\n\n\nContinuous\n2nd left ICS\nPatent Dutus Arteriosus",

    "text": "20.3 Investigation\nVarious investigations used in the diagnosis and management of heart diseases are:\n\nPulse Oximetry: The usefulness of pulse oximetry is in determining the heart rate and oxygen saturation. An oxygen saturation that is lower than expected (&lt;95% outside the early neonatal period) is considered abnormal, and a strong indication of a cyanotic heart disease in the presence of a non-pathologic lung.\nElectrocardiogram: The electrocardiogram is a common modality for the bedside investigation of heart diseases in all age groups. It gives indications of the heart rate, rhythm, chamber dilatation, wall thickness, laterality of the chambers, electrolyte abnormalities and even the presence of a head injury. It is often not conclusive in many heart conditions but serves as a good auxiliary test in children, especially post-surgery. There are various types: The routine ECG takes just a few minutes to perform on a resting patient usually lying supine. The stress ECG on the other hand is usually done with the heart under stress, as may happen during an aerobic exercise. The Holter ECG on the other hand is attached to the patient and continuously monitors the heart for 24 to 48 hours. This usually gives a better reflection of the electrical activity of the heart over a prolonged period, instead of just a brief period.\nX-ray: A chest x-ray is very useful in diagnosing and managing heart diseases in children. Fortunately, it is readily available in many parts of Ghana. Both posteroanterior and lateral chest X-rays can be useful in assessing the individual chamber and overall heart sizes. Cardiomegaly, assessed with a cardiothoracic ratio &gt; 60% in children is seen in many cases of heart disease. Chest X-rays also indicate ling pathologies, often showing as opacification or silhouetting. Increased lung markings for instance can be found in patients with VSD and ASD while decreased lung markings are often seen in Tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis. The shape of the heart is often an indicator of the underlying cardiac pathology. A Boot-shaped heart may indicate a Tetralofy of Fallot (Figure 20.7) while a globular-shaped heart points to dilated cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.

Old because it has been around since the 1960s, and new because it is relatively new in Ghana. It is however a very useful modality of investigation. An echocardiogram is essentially an ultrasound of the heart and great vessels. Its biggest advantage is its ability to visualise the heart in real-time, assess systolic and diastolic functions, measure chamber sizes and wall thickness, detect defects such as ventricular septal defect, determine valvular abnormalities such as stenosis and regurgitation, and even assess all these under stressful situation (stress echocardiogram). The video below illustrates the various echocardiographic views used in children. Unfortunately, since it is very user dependent it is not commonly available in Ghana with pediatric echocardiography only currently available in Accra, Kumasi, Cape Coast and Tamale.\n\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan and Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI): These are more advanced modalities available for use, especially when an echocardiogram is inconclusive or further study of the patient is necessary. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays taken at different angles to generate the image and does not the complication of significant X-ray radiation exposure. Both modalities can employ the use of contrast to delineate vessels.\nOthers: Other specialised investigatory modalities are used as required. These include cardiac catheterization in a specialised catheter laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\nKalisch-Smith, Jacinta Isabelle, Nikita Ved, and Duncan Burnaby Sparrow. 2019. “Environmental Risk Factors for Congenital Heart Disease.” Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology 12 (3): a037234. https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a037234.\n\n\nKo, Jung Min. 2015. “Genetic Syndromes Associated with Congenital Heart Disease.” Korean Circulation Journal 45 (5): 357. https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2015.45.5.357.\n\n\nØyen, Nina, Gry Poulsen, Heather A.

There are 3 main groups of causes:\n\nVentricular dysfunction: This is where there is a dysfunction of the ventricles. It is usually a systolic dysfunction but may also be diastolic. Examples are:\n\nCardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive and hypertrophic)\nMyocarditis\nArrhythmias\nCoronary artery anomalies\nPost-op cardiac dysfunction\n\nVolume overload: This occurs in conditions associated with increased volume (preload) in the heart especially the ventricles. The ventricle must therefore eject an increased blood volume, leading to tachycardia. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. Examples include:\n\nVentricular septal defect (left to right shunt)\nAtrial septal defect\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nAortic regurgitation (left ventricle)\nMitral regurgitation (Left atrium)\n\nPressure overload: This is when heart failure is caused by an increased pressure (afterload) in the heart. Ventricles must therefore contract against higher pressures. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. These include:\n\nHypertension\nAortic valve stenosis\nPulmonary stenosis\nCoarctation of the aorta\n\n\nIn all these, the result is decreased cardiac output and pulmonary oedema.",

Heart transplantation is the last option in some cases of heart failure.\n\n\n21.7.2 Pharmacological treatment\nTreatment depends on the clinical presentation and cause of the heart failure. There are 2 main groups to be considered:\n\n\n21.7.3 Acute decompensated heart failure\n\nDrugs used in acute decompensated heart failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\nAction\n\n\n\n\nDiuretics\nNotable here is furosemide. The aim is to help decongest the lungs, reduce preload by vasodilatation and improve heart failure symptoms.\n\n\nInotropes\nThese include adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine and dobutamine. They help improve the contractility of the heart, increase heart rate, and increase peripheral vascular resistance, thus maintaining the blood pressure and cardiac output. They are usually Intravenous medications.\n\n\n\n\n\n21.7.4 Chronic heart failure\nThese are usually oral medications given to treat heart failure on an outpatient basis\n\nDrugs for chronic heart failure treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nAction\n\n\n\n\nDiuretics\nThese are given to decongest the lungs, liver and other edematous organs. The most commonly used is furosemide.\n\n\nAldosterone antagonists\nThese counteract the aldosterone effect of water and sodium retention. They decrease afterload while helping in reversing cardiac remodelling.\n\n\nACE-I/ARB\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers counteract the renin effects of increasing afterload. They thus decrease the afterload and help reverse and prevent cardiac remodelling\n\n\nDigoxin\nThis is probably the oldest anti-heart failure medication. It has negative chronotropic and positive inotropic effects. Thus increasing contractility and reducing heart rate.\n\n\n\\(\\beta\\) -adrenergic blocking\nThese are adrenergic-blocking agents that work by decreasing sympathetic activity to the heart, decreasing heart rate, and thus decreasing oxygen demand. Examples are Propranolol, Atenolol and Carvedilol.",

Thus an uncomplicated ASD is acyanotic. The shunting also leads to volume overload of the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery and lungs. This consequently results in dilatation of the right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery, and pulmonary oedema. The low pressure in the atria implies low pressure in the right ventricle, pulmonary artery and lungs. This reduces the extent of pulmonary oedema and subsequently overt heart failure in a child with ASD, compared to other congenital heart defects such as ventricular septal defects. However, longstanding long-standing lesions or relatively large ones, especially those with a pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio of 2 or more could lead to heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension after about 15 to 20 years with subsequent reversal of the shunt.",

Thus, a VSD is usually an acyanotic congenital heart lesion. This leads to a volume overload of the pulmonary artery, lungs, left atrium and left ventricle. These chambers subsequently dilated. Pulmonary edema develops from lung congestion leading to signs of heart failure.\nSecondly, depending on the size of the defect the pressure in the left ventricle will get transmitted to the right. How much pressure is transmitted depends on the size of the defect with bigger defects transmitting more than smaller ones. This can result in increased right ventricular pressure, and hypertrophy. It also worsens the pulmonary oedema already mentioned above.\nPersistent pressure and volume overload cause remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in permanent changes and pulmonary hypertension. When the pulmonary pressure rises significantly higher than the systemic pressure, a reversal of the shunt results, leading to decreased oxygen saturation.",

    "text": "23.3 Clinical presentation\nThe clinical presentation of VSDs is variable and depends on the size and position.\nPosition: A perimembranous VSD of comparable size may exhibit more signs of heart failure than one that is mid-muscular or apical.\nSize: Generally, the sizes of VSDs determine the extent of the volume and pressure overload of the right heart and lungs. Larger ones result in relatively higher pressure and volume. Small VSDs are usually asymptomatic with no volume or pressure overload of the lung, pulmonary artery and right heart. Some volume and pressure overload usually accompanies moderate-sized VSDs. They are thus often accompanied by some heart failure and recurrent lower respiratory infections. Large defects are accompanied by severe volume and pressure overload. They present with persistent heart failure and failure to thrive, exercise intolerance. When longstanding, they often end up with significant pulmonary hypertension.\nNewborns with VSD may not have a murmur at birth. This is due to relatively high pulmonary pressure in the first weeks of life. The intensity of the murmur may increase as the pulmonary pressure decreases, usually over 4 weeks. The patient then becomes more symptomatic with a louder pansystolic murmur loudest at the lower left sternal border. Patients with a large defect may present with an apical diastolic rumble. Cyanosis may present in a long-standing large VSD with pulmonary hypertension.",

At birth, the rise in PaO2 and decline in prostaglandin concentration cause closure of the ductus arteriosus, typically beginning within the first 10 to 15 hours of life. If this normal process does not occur, the ductus arteriosus will remain patent. The PDA then results in excess blood shunting from the aorta, across the duct and into the pulmonary artery. This shunting causes volume overload. There is therefore a circuit of excess blood volume in the pulmonary arteries, lungs, left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta. This subsequently leads to dilatation of the left pulmonary artery, left atrium and left ventricle as well as pulmonary edema and heart failure.",

Conversely, patients with small PDAs are often asymptomatic.\nPulmonary vascular resistance when high does not encourage shunting across the duct. However, as the resistance drops the shunt gets worse, with worsening symptoms.\nModerate to larger shunts produce the symptoms of congestive heart failure as the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases over the first 6 to 8 weeks of life.\n\nThe physical examination depends on the size of the shunt, and to a lesser extent the age and maturity of the patient.\n\nPremature infants may present with:\n\nTachypnoea, crackles, tachycardia\nHyperdynamic precordium and bounding pulses with wide pulse pressure\nPansystolic murmur loudest at the left upper or mid-sternal border.\nWith a large PDA and equalization of pressure between the main pulmonary artery and the aorta, no murmur may be heard.\nSoft tender hepatomegaly\n\nInfants and older children with small PDAs may present with:\n\nA pansystolic murmur loudest in the 2nd left intercostal space\nMurmur becomes continuous as the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases over the first months of life.\n\nInfants and older children with moderate to large PDA may present with:\n\nLouder murmur with a harsh quality and acquires a machine-like quality often being heard posteriorly.

    "text": "26.4 Pathophysiology\n\nThe severity of clinical signs and symptoms depends on the proportion of the cardiac output going through the pulmonary artery, the relative pressures in the right and left ventricles and the proportion of the aorta overriding the VSD.\nThe VSD is normally of a significant size, which causes the systolic pressures between the ventricles to equalize. In mild ToF, the left ventricular pressures remain higher than the right ventricle, thus blood shunts from left to right through the VSD. These patients are normally acyanotic. In more severe diseases, due to increased right ventricular pressure (secondary to Pulmonary Stenosis), the shunt direction reverses from right to left allowing the mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood. This results in lower oxygenated blood in the systemic circulation; hence patients are cyanotic.\nPulmonary stenosis can be classified according to its location. The commonest site is the infundibular septum (50%). The stenosis may also be valvular (10%) or a combination (30%). This results in impaired flow of deoxygenated blood into the main pulmonary artery. It may be severe enough to cause intermittent right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This forms the basis of hypercyanotic episodes (tet spells).\nHypertrophy of the right ventricle occurs in response to the high pressures it must overcome to force deoxygenated blood through the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Compared to the normal heart, the aorta in ToF is dilated and displaced over the interventricular septum. Aortic dilatation is caused by an increase in blood flow through the aorta as it receives blood from both ventricles via the Ventricular Septal Defect.",

However, progressive cyanosis occurs in the first year of life. They usually have little or no signs of heart failure. Most will present with poor exercise tolerance which worsens as the child ages. In children who can walk, frequent squatting is observed in unrepaired ToF. Other features include poor feeding and poor weight gain.\nPhysical examination of children with ToF may reveal digital clubbing of varying stages, central cyanosis and plethora, usually seen in the hands and eyes. Auscultation classically reveals the first and second heart sounds with an ejection systolic murmur loudest at the upper to middle left sternal edge.",

This leads to a high demand for iron and increases susceptibility to iron deficiency. Furthermore, it is well documented that iron deficiency increases the chance of a hypercyanotic spell and stroke. Iron treatment in ToF is therefore key in its outpatient management. Nutritional rehabilitation is done for chronically malnourished patients.\nSurgical therapy is the definitive treatment. A Blalock-Taussig shunt can be done to improve oxygenation. A stand can also be inserted in younger children when deemed necessary.

    "text": "44.2 Ways of measuring blood pressure\n\nDirect intra-arterial measurements by placing a catheter into the vessel and measuring the pressure “in line” with the vessel (end-on-pressure). This method is used by physiologists and Intensivists. The principle is employed in the measurements of central venous pressure and intracranial pressure in clinical practice.\nThe auscultatory method is done with the use of a sphygmomanometer (either mercury or aneroid) and a stethoscope. This is the gold standard in clinical practice. Korotkoff sounds 1 and 5 sounds are measured for systolic and diastolic bleed pressures respectively. Values obtained are generally lower than direct & oscillometric measurements.\nThe palpation method (flush technique) is performed with the use of a sphygmomanometer and palpating finger. Largely unreliable. Only systolic blood pressure can be measured with this technique. The palpated pulse is generally lower than Korotkoff sound 1 by 10mmHg.\nThe oscillometric method uses a sphygmomanometer and a monitor e.g. digital blood pressure devices and Dynamap. Here, pulsatile blood flow through arterial wall oscillations is transmitted to the cuff encircling the extremity. Korotkoff sound 1 is recorded at the point of rapid increase in oscillation amplitude. Korotkoff sound 5 is recorded as the point of a sudden decrease in oscillation amplitude. Values obtained by oscillometric measurements are generally higher than auscultatory.\nDoppler ultrasound technique: Here a Doppler ultrasound is held over the pulse to magnify the sound so that it is audible without a stethoscope. The sound detected may be 5mmHg higher than Korotkoff sound 1.\nAmbulatory blood pressure measurements. Here, multiple measurements are recorded over time (e.g. 24 hours) with digital devices attached to the limb whilst the patient engages in normal activities outside the hospital. Results are analysed on a computer or paper tracer built into the device using the mean of the readings. It provides a truer picture of blood pressure trends useful in diagnosing “white coat hypertension” and nocturnal hypertension (absence of a normal physiological drop in blood pressure during sleep).",

The inability of cerebral vasculature to constrict appropriately in response to the abrupt increase in cerebral blood flow leads to cerebral hyperperfusion. Generally, short-acting antihypertensives are preferred in the initial instance of treatment so that any potentially harmful drop in blood pressure (which could lead to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome {PRES}) could be reversed. Subsequently, long-acting agents could be used Sublingual nifedipine could cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure so it is best avoided or should be used with extreme caution\nTreatment outline:\n\nUse anti-hypertensive drugs\nBlood pressure should be brought down slowly to a desirable level (?stage I) by 48hrs (though not to normal levels) as follows:\n\n1/3 of total blood pressure reduction in 1st 12-hrs\nNext one-third of the subsequent 12-hrs\nFinal one-third over 24-hrs\n\nAlternatively, by a quarter within 6 hours, and the rest in the next 24-36hrs\n\nCommonly preferred drugs include Labetalol infusion, Na nitroprusside infusion, and IV hydralazine infusion.

A less common cause is mosaicism which results in 3 copies of chromosome 13 in some cells and two copies in the others.

Several mutations in the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have been implicated. Such mutations are currently detected in approximately 70% of cases. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12q24.1 are by far the commonest.

Other supportive findings include polyhydramnios, short femur length, renal and cardiac defects (particularly pulmonary valve dysplasia) in the fetus. At birth, most affected neonates appear unremarkable. Birth weight and head circumference are usually within the normal range. A cardiac murmur may be detected on routine newborn examination. Male neonates may have cryptorchidism. The affected infant may present with feeding difficulties requiring ongoing nasogastric feeding or gastrostomy, which can impair growth. Talipes equinovarus may be present in 5% of patients. The characteristic facial features of NS become more apparent in early childhood and include a triangular-shaped face, hypertelorism, blue-green irises, down-slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, ptosis, low-set ears with thickened posteriorly rotated auricles, high nasal bridge and upturned nose, short webbed neck and micrognathia. Short stature is present in 85% of cases. Cutaneous features in childhood include lymphedema affecting the lower limbs and genitals, follicular keratosis of the face and extensor surfaces, multiple lentigines and café au lait spots. Musculoskeletal features include a shield chest, cubitus valgus, pectus carinatum or excavatum, scoliosis, and joint laxity. Affected children are usually hypotonic with delayed motor and speech development. Expressive language skills are more affected. A careful family history is important with emphasis on the presence of congenital heart disease, short stature or unusual facies among first-degree relatives.",

Other associated cardiac defects include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (30%), atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, and coarctation of the aorta. Most patients have more than one cardiac defect. Renal anomalies such as ectopic kidneys are present in 10% of cases. Fifty per cent of affected males have cryptorchidism with hypoplastic testes. There is an increased risk of the development of certain cancers because of gene mutations affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway, an important cell signalling pathway. These include neuroblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, low-grade glioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia and myeloproliferative disorders. There are associated autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune thyroiditis. Seizure disorders, unexplained peripheral neuropathy and intellectual disabilities have been documented in association with NS.",

The diagnosis is based on findings in three fundamental areas: characteristic facial dysmorphology, growth retardation and CNS involvement. In addition to these three primary features, prenatal alcohol exposure impairs cardiogenesis and subsequently results in congenital heart disease occurring in about 40 to 54% of children diagnosed with FAS. The estimated global prevalence of FASD among the general population is 7.7 cases per 1,000 individuals.

Although its effect can affect every stage of pregnancy, the risk of facial anomalies and major structural anomalies occurs with exposure during the first trimester, with irreversible damage. The possible teratogenic effects depend on the timing, frequency, duration, amount of alcohol exposure as well as genetic susceptibility. Ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde can alter fetal development by disrupting cellular differentiation and growth, disrupting DNA and protein synthesis and inhibiting cell migration resulting in the various anomalies that can occur. The pathogenesis of congenital heart disease in FAS is not well known but it is hypothesised that fetal alcohol exposure has deleterious effects on the composition of the cardiac extracellular matrix or cardiac fibroblasts based on studies performed in animals (mice).\nAdditionally, prenatal alcohol exposure has been shown to impair cardiac development through numerous cellular mechanisms, including reduction of retinoic acid levels, apoptosis of neural crest cells, suppression of histone acetylation, and altered gene expression. Animal studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure can induce a range of abnormalities in heart structure and function, including thinning of the ventricular walls, decreased ejection fraction (EF), reduced heart weight, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Overt congenital heart defect phenotypes such as ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular canal malformation, cardiac chamber malformations, great vessel defects, and double outlet right ventricle have also been identified in animals.",
