    "text": "7.1 Introduction\nJaundice is the yellowish discoloration of the skin, eyes and mucous membranes, caused by a pigment called bilirubin in the blood. Out of 10 term and 10 preterm infants, 6 and 8 of them will develop jaundice respectively, all in the 1st couple of weeks of life. Universally accepted as one of the commonest causes of admission and readmission in the first month of life. At KATH MBU, monthly admissions average between 300 and 400 and about 15 – 25% of all these admissions are cases of neonatal jaundice. Whereas the developed world describes kernicterus as a rare condition, unfortunately, the same cannot be said for us in developing countries. On average, cases of severe NNJ have ranged from 2.2% – 30.8% of all jaundice cases, with the monthly mortality from NNJ ranging from 2.8% - 15.2%. Remember, kernicterus is the only preventable cause of cerebral palsy!"

    "text": "7.2 Bilirubin metabolism\nHumans continuously form bilirubin and the liver is the main organ responsible for the metabolism of bilirubin. For every gram of Hemoglobin, 35mg of bilirubin is produced.\nThe bilirubin is conjugated by the UGT enzyme, making it water-soluble, which is then released into the bile before being excreted in the stool (and urine). It can also be broken down in the intestine by bacterial enzymes like E. coli. However, at birth, the newborn has several challenges. The liver is immature, and the levels of UGT are low. Newborns have β-glucuronidase in the intestinal mucosa/brush border, which deconjugates the conjugated bilirubin found in the meconium. The unconjugated bilirubin can now be reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and recycled back into the circulation. This process is known as the “enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin”. The gut is sterile and, subsequently, infants have far fewer bacteria in the gut, and so very little, if any, bilirubin is reduced to urobilin and stercobilin.\nSpecifically to newborns more bilirubin is produced, on account of the short life span of Red Blood Cells and high Hemoglobin levels. The liver is immature. They also have fewer bacteria and low intestinal enzymatic activity in the intestine"

Since this is an irreversible process, it leads to long-term neurological issues and even death."

    "section": "7.4 Types of Jaundice",
    "text": "7.4 Types of Jaundice\nThere are two main types of jaundice:\n\n\nPhysiological jaundice and\nPathological jaundice.\n\nThere are three main mechanisms for jaundice:\n\n\nIncreased bilirubin production\nDecreased bilirubin clearance and\nIncreased enterohepatic circulation.\n\n\n7.4.1 Physiological jaundice\n\n7.4.1.1 Increased bilirubin production\nin term newborn infants, bilirubin production is 2 – 3x higher than in adults. This occurs because newborns have more RBCs and fetal RBCs have a shorter life span than those in adults. Unfortunately, the liver being immature, cannot conjugate and excrete all the bilirubin from the breakdown of all the excess RBCs, thereby resulting in spillover of bilirubin into the blood.\n\n\n7.4.1.2 Bilirubin clearance or excretion\nThis is decreased in newborns, mainly due to the low levels of the UGT enzyme in the liver. UGT activity in term infants at day 7 of age is approximately 1% of that of the adult liver and does not reach adult levels until about 14 weeks of age.\n\n\n7.4.1.3 Enterohepatic circulation\nThe presence of the ß-glucuronidase results in an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, further increasing the bilirubin load in the infant. This is a diagnosis of exclusion\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Pathological jaundice\n\n7.4.2.1 Definition\nNeonatal jaundice is said to be pathologic if:\n\nJaundice in the 1st 24 - 48 hours of life.\nRate of SB rise &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (8.5µmol/L) per hour\nJaundice all over the body (including palms & soles)\nPresence of a danger sign\nHistory of previous siblings having had jaundice at birth\nJaundice in a term newborn after 2 weeks of age or in a preterm infant after 3 weeks of age\nDirect (conjugated) bilirubin concentration &gt; 20% of the total\n\nIt can be caused by certain pathologic conditions or exaggeration of the mechanisms responsible for physiologic neonatal jaundice. Identification of what is causing the jaundice is useful in guiding management, including counselling of the parents and what to expect for the next pregnancy. Most common cause is increased bilirubin production due to haemolytic disease processes that include the following:\n\nIsoimmune-mediated haemolysis (e.g., ABO or Rhesus D incompatibility)\nErythrocyte enzymatic defects, e.g. G6PD deficiency\nSepsis, especially Urinary Tract Infection\nPolycythaemia\nBirth Injuries resulting in sequestration of blood within a closed space, e.g. cephalohematoma, subgaleal bleed.\n\n\n\n7.4.2.2 ABO incompatibility\nThis is one of the most common causes of isoimmune hemolytic disease during the neonatal period. Infants with blood group A or B, carried by blood group O mother, will have a positive antibody because of maternal anti-A or anti-B transfer into the fetal circulation.\n\n\n7.4.2.3 Rhesus Incompatibility\nRh incompatibility can occur when an Rh-negative pregnant mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells secondary to feto-maternal haemorrhage during pregnancy/delivery. As a result, the mother’s blood gets exposed to the fetal circulation and sensitization occurs leading to maternal antibody production against the foreign Rh antigen. Once produced, maternal Rh (IgG) antibodies may cross freely from the placenta to the fetal circulation, where they form antigen-antibody complexes with Rh- positive fetal RBCs and eventually are destroyed, resulting in a fetal alloimmune-induced hemolytic anaemia and jaundice. The first pregnancy is usually not affected, but more antibodies are produced with each pregnancy making the jaundice worse with each pregnancy.\n\n\n7.4.2.4 Decreased clearance\nInherited defects in the gene that encodes the UGT liver enzyme (eg, Gilbert Syndrome), decrease bilirubin conjugation (eg Crigglar Najjar). In physiological jaundice, the levels are naturally low, but here, in addition to the low levels the UGT enzyme is either defective, absent or has a reduced function. This reduces hepatic bilirubin metabolism and its clearance thereby increasing the total serum unconjugated bilirubin levels.\n\n\n7.4.2.5 Increased enterohepatic circulation\nThe major causes are\n\n\nBreastfeeding jaundice\nBreast milk jaundice\nImpaired intestinal motility is caused by functional or anatomic obstruction.\nCongenital hypothyroidism also causes increased enterohepatic circulation on account of reduced gut motility."

    "text": "7.7 Management\nThe general principle of treatment includes\n\nEncourage frequent exclusive breastfeeding.\nStart Intravenous fluids only when there are signs of dehydration\nWatch out for danger signs\nPathologic Neonatal jaundice is treated with\n\nPhototherapy\nExchange Blood Transfusion (EBT)\nAntibiotics\n\n\nBe interested in the cause as this will serve as a guide in the management of the baby and direct your counselling as well as impact on subsequent pregnancies Loads of information in the maternal and child health record book, Gravidity and Parity, G6PD status, maternal Blood group & Rhesus status etc\n\n7.7.1 Investigations\nThis should include but not be restricted to\n\nSerum Bilirubin (conjugated, unconjugated and total)\nFull Blood Count\nG6PD screening\nBlood Culture & Sensitivity\nBaby’s blood group (only necessary if mother’s blood group is O)\nOthers include Direct Coomb’s test, Urine C & S etc\n\n\n\n7.7.2 Phototherapy\nPhototherapy is the use of visible light to treat high levels of serum bilirubin in the newborn.\n\n\n\nPhototherapy Unit\n\n\nThe dose of phototherapy is a key factor in how quickly it works. The dose in turn is determined by:\n\nThe wavelength of the light\nThe intensity of the light (irradiance)\nThe distance between the light and the baby\nThe body’s surface area is exposed to the light.\n\nEffective phototherapy lowers serum bilirubin levels by converting the lipid-soluble bilirubin into water-soluble forms that can easily be excreted in the stool and urine Phototherapy also prevents the need for an Exchange Blood Transfusion and prevents bilirubin from depositing in the brain. The breakdown of bilirubin begins almost instantaneously when the skin is exposed to light, hence, phototherapy should be started as early as possible.\nIn initiating phototherapy, always note the time the baby’s SBR sample is being taken and estimate the age in hours up until that time. Interpret bilirubin levels according to the baby’s postnatal age in hours and manage the bilirubin levels according to the threshold table Start phototherapy if the SBR plots on or above the line appropriate for age (in hours) and gestational age If the SBR plots just underneath the line, repeat the SBR after 6 hours or start phototherapy if a repeat is not feasible. Repeat the SBR at least 24 to 48 hours after initiation of phototherapy. Discontinue phototherapy when the SBR plots below the line.\nThe side effects of phototheratpy include:\n\nIncrease insensible water loss\nLoose stools\nSkin rash\nBronze baby syndrome\nHypo- or Hyperthermia\nInterruption of mother-baby bonding\n\n\n\n7.7.3 Sunlight Therapy\nWorks for physiological jaundice, however, one can never tell by looking at a baby what kind of jaundice a baby has Err on the side of caution, at least always have the SBR checked first Remember prolonged exposure to UV rays can be harmful to the developing skin Baby cannot be put in the light for more than 30 minutes in a day Even most of the available literature and studies that recommend sunlight still advice that if the jaundice is severe, the baby must be managed in the hospital!! A serum bilirubin high enough to warrant treatment should be managed in the hospital.\n\n\n7.7.4 Exchange Blood Transfusion\nProvides a means of rapid reduction of circulating bilirubin in the blood. Involves manual removal of the baby’s blood and simultaneously replacing it with compatible donor blood.\n\n\n\nExchange Blood Transfusion\n\n\nIn addition to reducing bilirubin levels, EBT removes partially hemolyzed RBCs, RBCs coated with antibodies and circulating immunoglobulins.\n\n\n\nBilirubin Graph (&gt; 38 weeks)\n\n\nComplication of exchange blood transfusion include:\n\nCardiac & respiratory disorders\nShock due to bleeding or inadequate replacement of blood infection\nCatheter-related complications\nChanges in the composition of the blood (high or low potassium, low calcium, low glucose, changes in pH)\nThrombocytopenia\nAnd the rare but serious complications of air embolism, portal hypertension, and necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\n\n\n7.7.5 Intravenous Immunoglobins\nTreatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been suggested as an alternative therapy to Exchange Blood Transfusion for isoimmune hemolytic jaundice to reduce the need for Exchange Blood Transfusion and duration of phototherapy and hospitalization in isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn. It has been proposed that IVIG blocks the binding of the antibody to the antigen. With this blockade, hemolysis no longer occurs."

Also, the peak systolic pressure in the left ventricle is higher than in the right. The diastolic pressure in the left ventricle is however lower than the right ventricle. In the typical adult heart, the following pressures are often observed. Also, both systolic and diastolic pressure in the aorta is higher than that in the pulmonary artery.\nSystolic pressure in general is generated by the ventricles. In conditions such as coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, the ventricles increase their workload to generate enough pressure. The diastolic pressure on the other hand is maintained by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Thus incompetent pulmonary or aortic valve leads to a decrease in diastolic pressure in the the tow vessels respectively."

By 20 days the paired endocardial tubes are formed. By day 35 the heart would have completed its looping with blood already flowing through.\nThree main shunts exist in the fetal circulation. These are adaptations to using the placenta rather than the lungs for oxygenation. These shunts are the ductus venosus, ductus arteriosus and patent foramen. At birth, these shunts regress, The ductus venosus regresses quickly to form the ligamentum arteriosus. The foramen ovale closes at birth physiologically but may take years to close anatomically. The patent ductus arteriosus closes soon after birth but can physiologically stay open for 72 hours. Beyond this period it is considered to be pathologic if it continues to stay open. Patent ductus arteriosus are quite common in preterm newborns."

Examples are:\n\nCardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive and hypertrophic)\nMyocarditis\nArrhythmias\nCoronary artery anomalies\nPost-op cardiac dysfunction\n\nVolume overload: This occurs in conditions associated with increased volume (preload) in the heart especially the ventricles. The ventricle must therefore eject an increased blood volume, leading to tachycardia. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. Examples include:\n\nVentricular septal defect (left to right shunt)\nAtrial septal defect\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nAortic regurgitation (left ventricle)\nMitral regurgitation (Left atrium)\n\nPressure overload: This is when heart failure is caused by an increased pressure (afterload) in the heart. Ventricles must therefore contract against higher pressures. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. These include:\n\nHypertension\nAortic valve stenosis\nPulmonary stenosis\nCoarctation of the aorta\n\n\nIn all these, the result is decreased cardiac output and pulmonary oedema."

The aim is to help decongest the lungs, reduce preload by vasodilatation and improve heart failure symptoms.\n\n\nInotropes\nThese include adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine and dobutamine. They help improve the contractility of the heart, increase heart rate, and increase peripheral vascular resistance, thus maintaining the blood pressure and cardiac output.

The most commonly used is furosemide.\n\n\nAldosterone antagonists\nThese counteract the aldosterone effect of water and sodium retention. They decrease afterload while helping in reversing cardiac remodelling.\n\n\nACE-I/ARB\nAngiotensen converting enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers counteract the renin effects of increasing afterload. They thus decrease the afterload and help reverse and prevent cardiac remodeling\n\n\nDigoxin\nThis is probably the oldest anti-heart failure medication. It has negative chronotropic and positive inotropic effects. Thus increasing contractility and reducing heart rate."

    "text": "32.2 Ways of measuring blood pressure\n\nDirect intra-arterial measurements by placing a catheter into the vessel and measuring the pressure “in line” with the vessel (end-on-pressure). This method is used by physiologists and Intensivists. The principle is employed in the measurements of central venous pressure and intracranial pressure in clinical practice.\nThe auscultatory method is done with the use of a sphygmomanometer (either mercury or aneroid) and a stethoscope. This is the gold standard in clinical practice. Korotkoff sounds 1 and 5 sounds are measured for systolic and diastolic bleed pressures respectively. Values obtained are generally lower than direct & oscillometric measurements.\nThe palpation method (flush technique) is performed with the use of a sphygmomanometer and palpating finger. Largely unreliable. Only systolic blood pressure can be measured with this technique. The palpated pulse is generally lower than Korotkoff sound 1 by 10mmHg.\nThe oscillometric method uses a sphygmomanometer and a monitor e.g. digital blood pressure devices and Dynamap. Here, pulsatile blood flow through arterial wall oscillations is transmitted to the cuff encircling the extremity. Korotkoff sound 1 is recorded at the point of rapid increase in oscillation amplitude. Korotkoff sound 5 is recorded as the point of a sudden decrease in oscillation amplitude. Values obtained by oscillometric measurements are generally higher than auscultatory.\nDoppler ultrasound technique: Here a Doppler ultrasound is held over the pulse to magnify the sound so that it is audible without a stethoscope. The sound detected may be 5mmHg higher than Korotkoff sound 1.\nAmbulatory blood pressure measurements. Here, multiple measurements are recorded over time (e.g. 24 hours) with digital devices attached to the limb whilst the patient engages in normal activities outside the hospital. Results are analysed on a computer or paper tracer built into the device using the mean of the readings. It provides a truer picture of blood pressure trends useful in diagnosing “white coat hypertension” and nocturnal hypertension (absence of a normal physiological drop in blood pressure during sleep)."

It is believed to cause endothelial dysfunction leading to microvascular and inflammatory injury to the kidneys. There are also reduced levels of endothelial-derived nitric oxide and associated elevation of the Renin-Aldosterone-Angiotensin System. Elevated uric acid levels in hypertensive individuals are associated with adverse outcomes like stroke. Allopurinol treatment is advocated for such individuals."

Other manifestations are:\n\nFacial palsy\nVisual changes→blindness\nComa\n\nPathophysiology: Disruption of the normal autoregulatory mechanisms of cerebral blood flow. The inability of cerebral vasculature to constrict appropriately in response to the abrupt increase in cerebral blood flow leads to cerebral hyperperfusion. Generally, short-acting antihypertensives are preferred in the initial instance of treatment so that any potentially harmful drop in blood pressure (which could lead to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome {PRES}) could be reversed. Subsequently, long-acting agents could be used Sublingual nifedipine could cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure so it is best avoided or should be used with extreme caution\nTreatment outline:\n\nUse anti-hypertensive drugs\nBlood pressure should be brought down slowly to a desirable level (?stage I) by 48hrs (though not to normal levels) as follows:\n\n1/3 of total blood pressure reduction in 1st 12-hrs\nNext one-third of the subsequent 12-hrs\nFinal one-third over 24-hrs\n\nAlternatively, by a quarter within 6 hours, and the rest in the next 24-36hrs\n\nCommonly preferred drugs include Labetalol infusion, Na nitroprusside infusion, and IV hydralazine infusion. After achieving the desired blood pressure target, oral antihypertensives are then started"

    "text": "16.2 Pathophysiology\nTypically a VSD without the presence of another congenital malformation results in a left to right ventricle shutning lesion because of the pressure difference. Thus, a VSD is usually an acyanotic congenital heart lesion. This leads to a volume overload of the pulmonary artery, lungs, left atrium and left ventricle. These chambers subsequently dilated. Pulmonary edema develops from lung congestion leading to signs of heart failure.\nSecondly, depending on the size of the defect the pressure in the left ventricle will get transmitted to the right. How much pressure is transmitted depends on the size of the defect with bigger defects transmitting more than smaller ones. This can result in increased right ventricular pressure, and hypertrophy. It also worsens the pulmonary oedema already mentioned above.\nPersistent pressure and volume overload cause remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in permanent changes and pulmonary hypertension. When the pulmonary pressure rises significantly higher than the systemic pressure, a reversal of the shunt results, leading to decreased oxygen saturation."

Larger ones result in relatively higher pressure and volume.\nSmall\nSmall VSDs are usually asymptomatic with no volume or pressure overload of the lung, pulmonary artery and right heart.\nModerate\nModerate-sized VSDs are usually accompanied by some volume and pressure overload. They are thus often accompanied by some heart failure and recurrent lower respiratory infections.\nLarge\nLarge defects are accompanied by severe volume and pressure overload. They present with persistent heart failure and failure to thrive, exercise intolerance. when longstanding, they often end up with significant pulmonary hypertension."
