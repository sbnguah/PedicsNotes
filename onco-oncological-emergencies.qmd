## Introduction

Oncological emergencies are acute, potentially life-threatening conditions that affect patients with
cancer, either due to the malignancy itself or as complications arising from its treatment. Early
recognition and prompt intervention are crucial in preventing morbidity and mortality. Understanding
these emergencies is essential for all healthcare professionals, particularly in resource-limited
settings like Ghana, where delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment are prevalent. Oncological
emergencies are generally classified into three categories:

1.  **Metabolic Emergencies**
2.  **Hematological Emergencies**
3.  **Structural/Mechanical Emergencies**

## Metabolic Emergencies

### Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)

**Definition:** A life-threatening condition that occurs when massive tumor cell lysis releases
intracellular contents (potassium, phosphate, uric acid) into the bloodstream, leading to acute
kidney injury and cardiac arrhythmias.

**Common Causes:**

-   High-grade lymphomas (especially Burkitt lymphoma)
-   Acute leukemias (e.g., ALL)
-   Solid tumors with high tumor burden after chemotherapy

**Clinical Features:**

-   Nausea and vomiting
-   Lethargy
-   Muscle cramps
-   Seizures
-   Oliguria or anuria
-   Arrhythmias

**Diagnostic Criteria (Cairo-Bishop):**

Laboratory TLS involves ≥2 of the following:

-   Uric acid \> 476 μmol/L
-   Potassium \> 6.0 mmol/L
-   Phosphate \> 1.45 mmol/L
-   Calcium \< 1.75 mmol/L

**Management:**

-   Aggressive IV hydratio
-   Allopurinol or rasburicase (rasburicase preferred)
-   Correction of electrolyte imbalances
-   Dialysis for refractory cases

### Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

**Definition:** Elevated serum calcium level (usually \>2.6 mmol/L) due to malignancy.

**Common Causes:**

-   Breast cancer
-   Multiple myeloma
-   Lung cancer
-   Renal cell carcinoma
-   Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) production

**Clinical Features:**

-   Nausea, vomiting
-   Polyuria, polydipsia
-   Constipation
-   Confusion, coma
-   Shortened QT interval

**Management:**

-   IV hydration with normal saline
-   Bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid)
-   Calcitonin for rapid reduction
-   Dialysis in severe cases

### Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH)

**Definition:** Excessive release of antidiuretic hormone leads to water retention and hyponatremia.

**Common Causes:**

-   Small cell lung carcinoma
-   CNS tumors

**Clinical Features:**

-   Headache
-   Confusion
-   Seizures
-   Coma

**Management:**

## Hematological Emergencies

### Febrile Neutropenia

**Definition:** Fever (\>38°C) with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 0.5 × 10⁹/L in a cancer
patient.

**Causes:**

-   Chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression

**Clinical Features:**

-   Fever (often the only sign)
-   Signs of infection may be subtle

**Management:**

-   Broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour (e.g., cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam)
-   Risk stratification (MASCC score)
-   G-CSF in selected cases
-   Isolate and monitor closely

### Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

**Definition:** Widespread activation of the coagulation system leads to the consumption of clotting
factors and platelets, resulting in bleeding and thrombosis.

**Common Causes:**

-   Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
-   Metastatic cancers

**Clinical Features:**

-   Bleeding (petechiae, ecchymosis, mucosal bleeding)
-   Thrombosis

-   Thrombocytopenia

**Management:**

-   Treat underlying cause (e.g., ATRA for APL)
-   Transfusions (platelets, FFP)
-   Heparin in cases with thrombosis

### Hyperviscosity Syndrome

**Definition:** Increased blood viscosity due to elevated cellular or protein components.

**Common Causes:**

-   Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (IgM)
-   Multiple myeloma
-   Leukemia with very high WBC

**Clinical Features:**

-   Visual disturbances
-   Headache
-   Mucosal bleeding
-   Confusion

**Management:**

-   Elevate the head
-   Steroids to reduce edema
-   Radiotherapy or chemotherapy, depending on etiology
-   Stenting in severe cases

### Spinal Cord Compression

**Definition:**

Compression of the spinal cord due to a tumor, leading to neurological deficits.

**Common Causes:**

-   Breast, prostate, and lung cancers
-   Lymphomas
-   Myeloma

**Clinical Features:**

-   Back pain (worsened by lying down)

## Approach to the Patient with an Oncological Emergency

**1. ABCDE Approach**

-   **Airway:** Ensure patency, especially in patients with superior vena cava syndrome or airway
    tumors.
-   **Breathing:** Provide oxygen if hypoxic.
-   **Circulation:** Monitor for signs of shock (e.g., tamponade, disseminated intravascular
    coagulation).
-   **Disability:** Assess for neurological compromise (e.g., spinal cord compression, raised ICP).
-   **Exposure:** Full examination to identify other signs (e.g., petechiae, masses).

**2. Laboratory and Imaging**

-   CBC, U&E, calcium, phosphate, uric acid
-   Coagulation profile
-   ECG and echocardiography
-   CT/MRI depending on clinical suspicion

**3. Specialist Referral**

-   Oncology, surgery, radiotherapy, hematology, or palliative care, depending on diagnosis.

**Challenges in the Ghanaian Setting**

-   Limited access to imaging (CT/MRI)
-   Delays in diagnosis and referral
-   Shortage of oncologists and hematologists
-   Limited availability of drugs (e.g., rasburicase, bisphosphonates)
-   Inadequate supportive care facilities (ICU, dialysis)

**Conclusion**

Oncological emergencies require prompt identification and urgent management to prevent irreversible
complications or death. In Ghana, with rising cancer incidence and limited resources, medical
students and junior doctors must be adept at recognizing early signs and initiating life-saving
interventions. Close collaboration with oncology, radiology, and surgical teams is essential for
optimal outcomes.
