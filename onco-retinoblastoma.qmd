## Introduction

Retinoblastoma is the most common **primary intraocular malignancy of childhood**, arising from the
retina. It typically presents before the age of 5 years and carries major implications for vision,
survival, and quality of life. The disease has become a paradigm for cancer genetics, as the RB1
tumour suppressor gene was the first tumour gene identified in humans.

Early diagnosis and treatment are critical: retinoblastoma is highly curable if detected early, but
advanced disease can be fatal. In high-income countries, survival exceeds 95%, while in many low-
and middle-income countries—including Ghana—delayed diagnosis often results in poorer outcomes.

## Incidence and Prevalence

-   Global incidence: about **1 in 15,000–20,000 live births**.
-   Accounts for **3–4% of all childhood cancers**.
-   Peak age:
    -   Unilateral disease: 2–3 years.
    -   Bilateral disease: diagnosed earlier, often before 1 year.
-   No sex predilection.
-   In Ghana and other sub-Saharan countries, children frequently present late, often with
    extraocular spread, which worsens survival rates.

## Aetiology

The development of retinoblastoma is intimately linked to the **RB1 gene** on chromosome 13q14.

-   **Heritable form** (40% of cases):
    -   Germline mutation in one allele of RB1 gene is inherited.
    -   Second hit occurs somatically in retinal cells.
    -   Usually bilateral and multifocal.
    -   Associated with increased risk of secondary malignancies (e.g., osteosarcoma).
-   **Non-heritable form** (60% of cases):
    -   Both RB1 mutations occur somatically.
    -   Usually unilateral and unifocal.

Rarely, retinoblastoma may arise from **MYCN amplification** even without RB1 mutation.

## Pathophysiology

The RB1 gene product regulates the **G1–S checkpoint** of the cell cycle. Loss of both functional
RB1 alleles leads to uncontrolled retinal cell proliferation.

-   Tumours originate from **retinal progenitor cells**.
-   Can grow in various patterns:
    -   **Endophytic**: growing into the vitreous.
    -   **Exophytic**: growing beneath the retina, leading to retinal detachment.
    -   **Diffuse infiltrating**: rare, spreading through the retina without forming a discrete
        mass.
-   Spread:
    -   Local invasion (into optic nerve, choroid, sclera).
    -   Extraocular spread (orbit, brain via optic nerve, systemic metastasis to bone marrow,
        liver).

## Clinical Features

Presentation varies depending on stage and extent of disease.

-   **Most common presenting sign**:
    -   **Leukocoria** (white pupillary reflex), often noticed in photographs with flash.
-   Other features:
    -   Strabismus (misalignment of eyes).
    -   Red, painful eye (from secondary glaucoma, uveitis, or tumour necrosis).
    -   Poor vision or blindness.
    -   Hyphema (blood in anterior chamber).
    -   Orbital swelling or proptosis (extraocular disease).
    -   Rare systemic symptoms in metastatic disease (bone pain, weight loss, fever).

## Differential Diagnosis

-   Coats’ disease (retinal telangiectasia with exudation).
-   Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous.
-   Congenital cataract.
-   Toxocariasis.
-   Retinal detachment.
-   Medulloepithelioma of the ciliary body.

## Investigations

-   **Ocular examination**:
    -   Indirect ophthalmoscopy under anaesthesia (definitive for diagnosis).
-   **Imaging**:
    -   **Ultrasound B-scan**: reveals intraocular mass with calcification.
    -   **CT scan**: useful for calcifications but limited due to radiation risk.
    -   **MRI of orbits and brain**: preferred for local extension (optic nerve, CNS).
-   **Laboratory tests**: not diagnostic, but baseline bloods useful before chemotherapy.
-   **Genetic testing**:
    -   Detects RB1 mutation.
    -   Guides family counselling and screening of siblings.

Biopsy of the eye is avoided due to risk of tumour spread.

## Staging

Two main systems:

1.  **International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification (IIRC)** – based on disease extent
    within the eye (Groups A–E).
2.  **International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS)** – for post-enucleation staging, including
    extraocular spread and metastasis.

## Treatment

Treatment depends on whether the disease is unilateral or bilateral, intraocular or extraocular, and
the aim (life preservation, eye salvage, vision preservation).

### Emergency Care

-   Treat secondary glaucoma for pain relief.
-   Manage raised intracranial pressure in cases of optic nerve invasion.

### Definitive and Ongoing Management

-   **Enucleation**: removal of the affected eye. Standard for unilateral advanced disease.
-   **Focal therapies** (for small tumours):
    -   Laser photocoagulation.
    -   Cryotherapy.
    -   Thermotherapy.
-   **Chemotherapy**:
    -   Systemic chemotherapy (vincristine, carboplatin, etoposide) for chemoreduction.
    -   Intra-arterial chemotherapy (direct to ophthalmic artery).
    -   Intravitreal chemotherapy (for vitreous seeds).
-   **Radiotherapy**:
    -   External beam (rare now, due to risk of secondary tumours in heritable cases).
    -   Plaque brachytherapy for selected cases.
-   **Bilateral disease**: efforts made to preserve at least one eye with useful vision.

### Preparation for Discharge

-   Educate parents on prosthesis care after enucleation.
-   Importance of follow-up for recurrence detection.
-   Genetic counselling for families with heritable disease.

### Long-Term Management

-   Regular ophthalmologic examinations under anaesthesia.
-   Screening for second malignancies in heritable cases.
-   Monitoring growth, vision development, and psychosocial adjustment.

## Complications

-   Local recurrence within the eye or orbit.
-   Extraocular spread with poor prognosis.
-   Metastases to CNS, bone marrow, or distant organs.
-   Vision loss, especially in bilateral disease.
-   Cosmetic issues after enucleation.
-   Secondary malignancies in heritable retinoblastoma, particularly osteosarcoma and soft tissue
    sarcomas (especially after radiotherapy).

## Prognosis

-   In high-income countries: \>95% survival.
-   In sub-Saharan Africa: survival often \<40%, mainly due to late presentation, extraocular
    disease, and limited treatment resources.
-   Prognosis is best with early detection, small intraocular tumours, and access to multimodal
    therapy.

## Prevention

-   No known prevention for sporadic cases.
-   **Genetic counselling and testing**: vital in families with heritable retinoblastoma.
-   Screening of at-risk infants (regular eye exams from birth to 5 years).
-   Avoid unnecessary exposure to ionising radiation in heritable cases.

## Conclusion

Retinoblastoma is a highly curable childhood malignancy when detected early. The disease highlights
the importance of integrating **clinical suspicion, imaging, genetic counselling, and multimodal
therapy** in management. In Ghana and similar settings, community education to recognise leukocoria
early, improved access to ophthalmic oncology, and support for families can dramatically improve
survival and quality of life.
