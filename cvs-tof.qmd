## Definition

Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is a conotruncal defect resulting from anterior malalignment of the
infundibular septum, giving rise to four components:

-   Large, unrestrictive [Ventricular Septal Defect](cvs-vsd.qmd)
-   The aorta overriding the interventricular septum
-   Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, including at the infundibulum, main and branch
    pulmonary arteries
-   Right ventricular hypertrophy

## Incidence/prevalence

It is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. About 1 in 3500 babies born in the US are
born with ToF. Accounts for 7–10% of all congenital cardiac malformations. More common in Males. In
a series of echocardiograms done in Kumasi, Ghana ToF was the most common cyanotic congenital heart
disease seen in 13% of all heart diseases. There was a significant male preponderance with a female
vs male prevalence of 10% vs 15% respectively.

## Aetiology

Although there is no known definite cause as to why some babies develop ToF in utero, certain
environmental and biological factors are known to increase the risk:

-   **Genetic**: CHARGE syndrome, chromosome 22q11 microdeletion ([Di George
    syndrome](synd-digeorge.qmd)), [Down syndrome](), [Edward's syndrome](synd-edwards.qmd), or
    [Patau syndrome](synd-patau.qmd), VACTERL association

-   **Teratogens**: maternal diabetes mellitus, retinoic acid exposure, maternal phenylketonuria
    (PKU), Alcohol ([fetal alcohol syndrome](synd-fetal-alcohol.qmd)), Warfarin (fetal warfarin
    syndrome), Trimethadione: antiepileptic drug

## Pathophysiology

-   The severity of clinical signs and symptoms depends on the proportion of the cardiac output
    going through the pulmonary artery, the relative pressures in the right and left ventricles and
    the proportion of the aorta overriding the VSD.
-   The VSD is normally of a significant size, which causes the systolic pressures between the
    ventricles to equalize. In mild ToF, the left ventricular pressures remain higher than the right
    ventricle, thus blood shunts from left to right through the VSD. These patients are normally
    acyanotic. In more severe diseases, due to increased right ventricular pressure (secondary to
    Pulmonary Stenosis), the shunt direction reverses from right to left allowing the mixing of
    deoxygenated and oxygenated blood. This results in lower oxygenated blood in the systemic
    circulation; hence patients are cyanotic.
-   Pulmonary stenosis can be classified according to its location. The commonest site is the
    infundibular septum (50%). The stenosis may also be valvular (10%) or a combination (30%). This
    results in impaired flow of deoxygenated blood into the main pulmonary artery. It may be severe
    enough to cause intermittent right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This forms the basis
    of hypercyanotic episodes (tet spells).
-   Hypertrophy of the right ventricle occurs in response to the high pressures it must overcome to
    force deoxygenated blood through the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Compared to
    the normal heart, the aorta in ToF is dilated and displaced over the interventricular septum.
    Aortic dilatation is caused by an increase in blood flow through the aorta as it receives blood
    from both ventricles via the [Ventricular Septal Defect](cvs-vsd.qmd).

## Signs and symptoms

Patients with Tof are often not born with cyanosis. This may lead to the diagnosis being missed at
birth. However, progressive cyanosis occurs in the first year of life. They usually have little or
no signs of [heart failure](cvs-heart-failure.qmd). Most will present with poor exercise tolerance
which worsens as the child ages. In children who can walk, frequent squatting is observed in
unrepaired ToF. Other features include poor feeding and poor weight gain.

Physical examination of children with ToF may reveal digital clubbing of varying stages, central
cyanosis and plethora, usually seen in the hands and eyes. Auscultation classically reveals the
first and second heart sounds with an ejection systolic murmur loudest at the upper to middle left
sternal edge.

## Investigations

Bedside pulse oximetry often reveals an oxygen saturation of less than 90%. A chest X-ray shows a
normal-sizedeart with the classical boot shape, decreased pulmonary vascular markings and in about
30% of the cases, a right aortic arch.

An electrocardiogram, though non-specific may show right axis deviation, right ventricular
hypertrophy, and right atrial enlargement.

An echocardiogram is the most useful diagnostic modality. It delineates the defect by showing the
anterior malalignment [Ventricular Septal Defect](cvs-vsd.qmd), degree of infundibular stenosis,
state of the pulmonary artery and/or branches, and the overriding aortic arch sidedness. Other
anatomical abnormalities that may co-exist eg. Atrioventricular Canal Defects, [Atrial Septal
Defect](cvs-asd.qmd) and coronary artery abnormalities can also be obtained. A CT angiogram and
Magnetic Resonance Angiography can be done in complex cases and preparation for surgery.

## Treatment

Since patients with ToF hardly experience [heart failure](cvs-heart-failure.qmd), antifailure
medications are not the mainstay of treatment.

Untreated cyanotic congenital heart disease is associated chronic hypoxic state which leads to
polycythemia. This leads to a high demand for iron and increases susceptibility to iron deficiency.
Furthermore, it is well documented that iron deficiency increases the chance of a hypercyanotic
spell and stroke. Iron treatment in ToF is therefore key in its outpatient management. Nutritional
rehabilitation is done for chronically malnourished patients.

Surgical therapy is the definitive treatment. A Blalock-Taussig shunt can be done to improve
oxygenation. A stand can also be inserted in younger children when deemed necessary. Definitive
corrective surgery should be done for all children with ToF.

## Natural history

Features of ToF are progressive if not corrected surgically. There is usually progressive dyspnoea
on exertion and cyanosis as the child ages. However, some "pink tets" can live very well into
adulthood. Untreated, approximately 50% will live to their 6th birthday.

## Complications

A feared presentation in untreated children with a ToF is the hypercyanotic spell (Tet spell). This
is treated further below. Other complications can result from the emboli effect leading to stroke
and cerebral abscess. High hematocrit may lead to hyperviscosity, headache and dizziness. [Infective
endocarditis](cvs-inf-endo.qmd) is another known complication. Long-term complications include right
ventricular dysfunction, coagulopathy and arrhythmias.

## Prognosis

Repaired, the 25-year survival is about 95%.[@smith2019] Unrepaired most will die by their 10th
birthday. This is especially so for those with other genetic syndromes and associated malformations.

## Differential diagnosis

Cyanosed ToF patients have a differential diagnosis of Transposition of the great arteries,
Tricuspid atresia, pulmonary atresia, etc. Pink tets will have a differential diagnosis of a
[Ventricular Septal Defect](cvs-vsd-qmd)

## Prevention

## Hypercyanotic spell

Hypercyanotic spell (tet spell) is an emergency in children with Tof and to a lesser extent other
cyanotic congenital heart diseases. Presentation is usually those less than 2 years. • Paroxysms of
hyperpnoea due to increased right-to-left shunting, carbon dioxide accumulates therefore stimulating
the central respiratory center. This unfortunately causes further right-to-left shunting thus
perpetuating the hypoxia. • Irritability – manifested by prolonged, unsettled crying. • Increasing
cyanosis • May be precipitated by dehydration, anaemia or prolonged crying (induces tachycardia and
reduced systemic vascular resistance). • Decreased intensity for a heart murmur. The treatment goal
is to increase preload and promote pulmonary blood flow. • The child should be placed in a
knee-chest position. • Administer oxygen (limited value so do not force it if the infant is
combative) • Volume expansion with intravenous fluids • IM/SC morphine (0.1mg/kg) • Use of
alpha-agonists such as Phenylephrine • IV Propranolol (for immediate therapy), oral propranolol for
long-term prophylaxis for those with pulmonary artery stenosis • Iron supplementation. • Correction
of metabolic acidosis with NaHCO~3~.
