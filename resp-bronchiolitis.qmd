## Introduction

Bronchiolitis is a common viral infection of the lower respiratory tract that primarily affects
infants and young children. It is the leading cause of hospitalization for children under 2 years of
age worldwide. In Ghana and other sub-Saharan African countries, bronchiolitis significantly
contributes to infant morbidity and mortality, especially during the harmattan season when
respiratory infections are more prevalent.

Understanding bronchiolitis is essential for medical students, particularly in environments where
diagnostic tools are scarce and treatment depends largely on clinical skills and supportive care.

## Definition

**Bronchiolitis** is defined as an **acute viral infection of the lower respiratory tract**,
primarily affecting the **bronchioles**. It leads to inflammation, edema, and increased mucus
production, resulting in **airway obstruction**, **wheezing**, and **respiratory distress**.

## Epidemiology

-   **Age group**: Primarily affects children **under 2 years**, most commonly **under 6 months**
-   **Peak incidence**: During the **cold and dry months** (November to February in Ghana)
-   **Transmission**: Highly contagious; spread via **respiratory droplets**, **direct contact**, or
    **contaminated surfaces**
-   **High-risk groups**:
    -   Premature infants
    -   Infants with congenital heart disease
    -   Children with chronic lung disease
    -   Immunocompromised children
    -   Children exposed to tobacco smoke or indoor air pollution

## Etiology (Causative Agents)

The most common cause is **Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)**, responsible for 50–80% of cases.

**Other viruses:**

-   Human metapneumovirus
-   Parainfluenza virus
-   Influenza virus
-   Rhinovirus
-   Adenovirus
-   Coronavirus

## Pathophysiology

1.  **Viral infection** of the **nasal and lower respiratory epithelium**
2.  Inflammation and edema of the bronchioles
3.  Necrosis and sloughing of epithelial cells
4.  Increased mucus production and plugging of small airways
5.  Air trapping and **hyperinflation**, leading to:
    -   Increased work of breathing
    -   Impaired gas exchange
    -   **Hypoxia** and, in severe cases, **respiratory failure**

## Clinical Features

**History**

-   Starts as an **upper respiratory tract infection** (e.g., runny nose, mild cough)
-   Progresses over 2–3 days to:
    -   **Cough**
    -   **Tachypnea**
    -   **Wheezing**
    -   **Poor feeding**
    -   **Apnea** (especially in premature or very young infants)
    -   **Fever** (may or may not be present

**Examination**

-   **Tachypnea**
-   **Nasal flaring**
-   **Chest retractions** (intercostal, subcostal, suprasternal)
-   **Wheezing** and **crackles** on auscultation
-   **Hypoxia** (low oxygen saturation)
-   **Dehydration**
-   **Cyanosis** in severe cases

## Differential Diagnosis

|  |  |
|----|----|
| **Condition** | **Key Features** |
| Asthma | Older children (\>2 years), recurrent episodes, personal/family history of atopy |
| Pneumonia | Fever, focal crackles, lobar consolidation on chest X-ray |
| Foreign body aspiration | Sudden onset, localized wheeze, asymmetric breath sounds |
| Congenital heart disease | Cyanosis, poor weight gain, murmur |
| Pertussis | Paroxysmal cough, whoop, post-tussive vomiting |

## Diagnosis

**Clinical diagnosis is key in most settings, especially where investigations are limited.**

**Investigations (if available)**

-   **Pulse oximetry**: Assess oxygen saturation
-   **Chest X-ray** (not routinely indicated): May show hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening,
    patchy atelectasis
-   **Nasopharyngeal swab** for viral testing (e.g., RSV) – rarely available in Ghana
-   **Complete blood count**: To rule out bacterial infection if fever is high or toxic appearance
-   **Serum electrolytes**: In severely ill or dehydrated children

## Severity Assessment

**Mild**

-   Normal feeding
-   Mild tachypnea, minimal retractions
-   Oxygen saturation ≥ 92%

**Moderate**

-   Poor feeding
-   Moderate tachypnea and retractions
-   Wheezing or crackles
-   Oxygen saturation 90–92%

**Severe**

-   Marked retractions, grunting, nasal flaring
-   Apnea
-   Cyanosis
-   Oxygen saturation \< 90%
-   Lethargy or altered mental status

## Management

### General Principles

-   Most cases are **self-limiting** and can be managed with **supportive care**
-   Hospitalization is required for:
    -   Moderate to severe disease
    -   Apnea
    -   Inability to feed
    -   Oxygen saturation \< 90%
    -   High-risk infants

### Outpatient (Home-Based) Management

-   Ensure **adequate hydration** and feeding
-   Educate caregivers on danger signs:
    -   Rapid breathing
    -   Chest in-drawing
    -   Inability to feed
    -   Cyanosis
    -   Lethargy
-   Clear nasal secretions with saline drops/suction
-   Follow-up in 24–48 hours

### Inpatient (Hospital) Management

**1. Supportive Care**

-   **Oxygen therapy**:
    -   Give oxygen if SpO₂ \< 90%
    -   Via nasal prongs or face mask
-   **Hydration and nutrition**:
    -   Encourage breastfeeding or oral feeds
    -   NG tube feeding or IV fluids if unable to feed orally
-   **Monitoring**:
    -   Respiratory rate
    -   Oxygen saturation
    -   Fluid status
    -   Level of consciousness

### Medications (Avoid routine use)

|  |  |
|----|----|
| **Medication** | **Recommendation** |
| **Bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol)** | Not routinely recommended; trial may be considered in wheezing children \>12 months |
| **Steroids** | Not beneficial in uncomplicated bronchiolitis |
| **Antibiotics** | Not indicated unless bacterial co-infection suspected (e.g., pneumonia, otitis media) |
| **Nebulized hypertonic saline** | Limited evidence; not routinely used in Ghana |
| **Antiviral agents** | Not routinely available or used in Ghana |

## Complications

-   **Apnea**
-   **Respiratory failure**
-   **Dehydration and poor nutrition**
-   **Secondary bacterial infections**
-   **Recurrent wheezing or asthma-like episodes** later in life
-   **Death** (in severe, untreated cases, particularly in high-risk infants)

## Prevention

**1. Infection Control**

-   **Hand hygiene**
-   **Avoid crowding**, especially in daycares and nurseries
-   Educate caregivers on **cough etiquette**

**2. Breastfeeding**

-   Exclusive breastfeeding for the first **6 months** provides protective antibodies

**3. Avoid Smoke Exposure**

-   Avoid smoking near infants
-   Reduce indoor air pollution (e.g., smoke from firewood)

**4. Immunization**

-   Ensure up-to-date **vaccination**, especially:
    -   **Influenza vaccine**
    -   **Pneumococcal vaccine**
    -   **Pertussis vaccine**

**5. Prophylaxis (Palivizumab)**

-   A monoclonal antibody used for **RSV prophylaxis**
-   Expensive and not readily available in Ghana
-   Considered only for **very high-risk infants** in specialized centers

## Prognosis

-   Most children **recover fully within 7–10 days**
-   **Cough** may persist for 2–3 weeks
-   Infants with severe disease may have **recurrent wheezing or asthma**

## Special Considerations in Ghana

-   **Overcrowded homes** and **poor air quality** increase risk
-   Health-seeking behavior may be delayed due to cultural beliefs or access issues
-   Resource limitations often mean:
    -   Reliance on clinical diagnosis
    -   Limited access to oxygen and pulse oximetry
-   Need for **education of caregivers** about early signs of respiratory distress
-   Emphasize **community-based health interventions** (e.g., CHPS compounds)

## Case Scenario

**Case: 4-month-old male infant**

**Presentation:**

-   3-day history of cough, runny nose, and poor feeding
-   Developed fast breathing and wheezing today
-   No fever
-   No significant past medical history

**On examination:**

-   RR: 68 breaths/min
-   Chest retractions present
-   O₂ saturation: 88% on room air
-   Nasal flaring, scattered wheeze

**Diagnosis:**

-   Likely **moderate to severe bronchiolitis**

**Management:**

-   Admit for supportive care
-   Oxygen via nasal prongs
-   NG tube feeding due to poor suck
-   Monitor vitals and oxygen saturation
-   Educate mother on hand hygiene and signs of deterioration

## Conclusion

Bronchiolitis is a common and potentially severe illness affecting infants and young children in
Ghana. Early recognition and supportive management are essential to preventing complications.
Medical students need to be familiar with its presentation, clinical evaluation, and evidence-based
treatment, especially in resource-limited healthcare settings where advanced diagnostics may not be
available.
