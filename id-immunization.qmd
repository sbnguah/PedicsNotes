## Introduction

Childhood immunization is a cornerstone of public health, offering lifesaving protection against
infectious diseases. It is one of the most cost-effective strategies for reducing morbidity and
mortality in children worldwide. Immunization is vital in achieving [Sustainable Development Goal
(SDG) 3](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3 "SDG 3"), which aims to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 per
1000 live births and under-five mortality to 25 per 1000 live births by 2030. Despite its
effectiveness, challenges such as parental misconceptions, healthcare accessibility, vaccine
hesitancy, and logistical issues persist.

## Key Immunization Concepts

-   **Immunization**: The process of artificially conferring immunity against infectious diseases.
-   **Vaccination**: The act of introducing an antigenic material into the body to stimulate an
    immune response, leading to future protection upon exposure.
-   **Vaccine**: A biological preparation that enhances active acquired immunity against specific
    pathogens. Vaccines can be live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit, toxoid-based, or nucleic
    acid-based.

## Types of Vaccines

Vaccines are classified based on their composition and mechanism:

1.  **Live Attenuated Vaccines**: Contain weakened pathogens (e.g., Measles, Mumps, Rubella, BCG,
    Yellow Fever, OPV).
2.  **Killed/Inactivated Vaccines:** Pathogens are killed but retain their immunogenic properties
    (e.g., Hepatitis A, Rabies, IPV).
3.  **Toxoid-Based Vaccines**: Contain inactivated toxins to generate immunity (e.g., Tetanus,
    Diphtheria).
4.  **Subunit/Conjugate Vaccines**: Use fragments of pathogens for immunity (e.g., Pneumococcal,
    Hib, Hepatitis B).
5.  **Nucleic Acid-Based Vaccines**: Utilize mRNA or DNA to instruct cells to produce an immune
    response (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 vaccines).

## Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Ghana

Ghana's routine immunization schedule includes:

-   **Birth:** BCG, OPV (0)
-   **6 Weeks:** Pentavalent (DTwP/HepB/Hib), OPV (1), PCV (1), Rotavirus (1)

-   **18 Months:** MR Booster, Meningococcal A, RTS,S (4)
-   **Adolescents:** HPV vaccine for girls aged 10-13.

## Principles of Immunization

-   **Herd Immunity:** High vaccination coverage reduces disease transmission.
-   **Cold Chain Management:** Essential for vaccine potency.
-   **Missed Opportunities:** Ensuring timely vaccination enhances community protection.
-   **Vaccine Safety:** Strict protocols ensure vaccines are safe and effective.

## Contraindications to Vaccination

While vaccines are generally safe, contraindications exist:

-   **Live vaccines** should be avoided in **immunocompromised individuals**.
-   **Severe allergic reactions** (anaphylaxis) to vaccine components.
-   **Pregnancy** – Certain live vaccines (e.g., Yellow Fever, Measles) are contraindicated.

## Vaccine-Preventable Diseases & Control Programs

Immunization programs target several infectious diseases:

-   **Tuberculosis (BCG):** Protects against severe TB forms in infants.
-   **Polio:** Eradication efforts involve IPV and OPV.
-   **Pneumococcal Disease (PCV13):** Prevents pneumonia, meningitis.
-   **Rotavirus:** Reduces childhood diarrheal deaths.
-   **Measles, Rubella, Mumps (MR/MMR):** Prevents severe complications.
-   **Meningococcal Disease (Men A):** Prevents outbreaks.
-   **Yellow Fever:** Essential for endemic regions.
-   **HPV:** Prevents cervical cancer.

## Challenges & Future Directions

-   **Vaccine Hesitancy:** Addressing misinformation.
-   **New Vaccine Development:** Ongoing innovations like mRNA vaccines.
-   **Policy & Surveillance:** Strengthening disease monitoring to prevent outbreaks.

## Specific vaccines

    bacillus)
-   **Type:** Live attenuated, freeze-dried
-   **Storage:** 2°C - 8°C (Never frozen)
-   **Administration:** Intradermal (deltoid)
-   **Shelf Life:** 12 - 18 months
-   **Usage:** Do not shake to mix; use within 2 hours
-   **Efficacy:**
    -   0–80% for Pulmonary TB (PTB)
    -   75–86% for Miliary TB & TB Meningitis
-   **Indications:**
    -   Infants, health personnel, and contacts with sputum-positive cases.
    -   Suspected exposure? Perform a tuberculin test before immunization.
    -   In cases of contact: Tuberculin test, repeat after 6 months. If positive ⇒ Chemoprophylaxis.
-   **Notes:**
    -   Duration of immunity is uncertain; it wanes over time.
    -   Protects children against meningitis & disseminated TB but does not prevent primary
        infection or reactivation.
    -   Scar confirms vaccination but not protection. Absence of a scar may indicate the need for
        testing and revaccination.
    -   Up to 10% scar failure rate is acceptable in properly vaccinated individuals.
    -   Tuberculin test: Uses Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) for Mantoux/Heaf test.

-   **Catch-up Vaccination:** Not recommended in public health programs.

### Malaria Vaccines and Immunization Strategy

Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in endemic regions. The
**Plasmodium falciparum life cycle** involves two distinct stages:

1.  **Asexual Stage (Human Host)** – Sporozoites enter the bloodstream through mosquito bites,
    travel to the liver, and mature into merozoites before infecting red blood cells.
2.  **Sexual Stage (Mosquito Vector)** – Gametocytes ingested by mosquitoes undergo development,
    enabling transmission.

**RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine**

The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine provides partial protection against **Plasmodium falciparum**
infection.

-   **Mechanism of Action**:
    -   Induces **antibody production** to block sporozoite entry into liver cells.
    -   Activates **T-cell responses** to eliminate sporozoites that reach the liver.
-   **Administration**:
    -   **Four-dose series**:

        -   **1st dose** at **5 months** (not recommended for infants
        -   **2nd and 3rd doses** administered at **4-week intervals**.
        -   **4th dose** given between **15–18 months**

    -   Can be co-administered with other vaccines in **national immunization programs**
-   **Efficacy**: Less than **50%**, but beneficial for reducing severe cases and mortality.
-   **Recommendations**: Targeted for **high-malaria-burden African countries** with existing
    control programs.

### Rabies Vaccines and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

Rabies is a fatal viral zoonosis transmitted through the bite of infected animals (mainly carnivores
and bats).

-   **Disease Determinants**:
    -   Severity of wound and viral inoculation.
    -   Proximity of bite to central nervous system (higher risk if near head).
    -   Timeliness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).
-   **Rabies Virus (RABV) Presence in Humans**:
    -   Found in saliva, tears, urine, and nervous tissues.
    -   Not detected in blood.
-   **Incubation Period**: 1-3 months, but may extend up to 1 year

**Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**

-   **Immediate wound cleansing**.
-   **Rabies vaccine series initiation**.
-   **Rabies immunoglobulin (Rabies IG)** infiltration around the wound (if indicated).

**Rabies Vaccine Types**

-   Cell Culture or Embryonated Egg Vaccines (CCEECV):
    -   Live attenuated, freeze-dried (propagated in human diploid or chick embryo).
    -   Administered intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID) on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28.
    -   Preferred site of administration: Deltoid (adults) or anterolateral thigh (children)
-   Nerve Tissue Vaccines (NTV) (Obsolete):
-   Derived from animal brain tissue.
-   Associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, encephalitis.
-   Not recommended by WHO.

**Note**: Chloroquine prophylaxis suppresses rabies vaccine antibody response, particularly when
given intradermally.

### Influenza and COVID-19 Vaccines

#### Influenza Virus and Vaccine Development

Influenza viruses undergo continuous genetic variations, requiring annual vaccine updates.

-   Antigenic Drift – Small mutations producing minor variants (Influenza A, B) → epidemics.
-   Antigenic Shift – Major genetic reassortments (Influenza A only) → pandemics.

#### COVID-19 Vaccine Technologies

-   **Inactivated or Weakened Virus** – Uses killed virus components.
-   **Protein-Based Vaccines** – Uses harmless protein fragments to generate immunity.
-   **Viral Vector Vaccines** – Genetically engineered virus produces spike proteins.
-   **RNA/DNA Vaccines** – Uses mRNA/DNA encoding spike proteins (e.g., Moderna, Pfizer).

## Vaccine Reactions and Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)

### Minor Vaccine Reactions

-   Common reactions occur as part of the immune response:
    -   Fever, injection-site swelling/pain, malaise.
    -   Most frequent with DPT vaccines.
    -   Symptoms self-resolve.
-   Parents should be educated on symptom management.

### Severe Reactions (Rare)

-   Anaphylaxis (1 per million doses) – Requires urgent medical intervention (e.g., adrenaline).
-   BCG Osteitis – Rare, vaccine-specific reaction.
-   Vaccine-Induced Fainting – Common in adolescents, often misinterpreted as anaphylaxis.

### AEFI Classification

1.  **Vaccine Reaction** – Direct response to vaccine components.
2.  **Program Error** – Due to improper vaccine handling/administration
3.  **Coincidental** – Occurs post-immunization but is unrelated to vaccination.
4.  **Injection Reaction** – Pain/anxiety linked to the injection process.
5.  **Unknown Cause** – Unresolved cases

## Vaccine Storage and Multidose Vial Policy

-   **Cold Chain Maintenance**: Essential for vaccine efficacy and stability.
-   **Heat Sensitivity**:
    -   BCG, Measles, Polio can be frozen.
    -   Diluent-containing vaccines (DPT, TT, HepB) must NOT be frozen.
    -   Frozen vaccines may cause reduced immune response
-   **Shelf Life**: Max 2 years under ideal storage.
-   **Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVM)**:
-   Monitor vaccine exposure to heat.
-   Discard if VVM reaches critical stages.

### Multidose Vial Policy (Current Guidelines)

-   Vaccines usable for up to 4 weeks if:
    -   Stored at 2–8°C.
    -   Aseptic techniques are used for administration.
    -   VVM remains intact.
-   Reconstituted vaccines (BCG, Measles, Yellow Fever):
-   Must be discarded after 6 hours or at the end of the session.

**Contraindications to Vaccination**

-   **Live vaccines contraindicated in**:
    -   Immunocompromised individuals (HIV, malignancies).
    -   Pregnant women (risk of teratogenicity).
    -   Neurological disorders (avoid DPT in uncontrolled epilepsy).
-   **Egg allergy**: Avoid Yellow Fever, Influenza, but alternative fibroblast-derived vaccines may
    be used.

## Vaccination in Special Populations

### Preterm Infant Immunization

-   Immunization response similar to term infants.
-   Start immunization at 2 months, irrespective of prematurity.
-   OPV delayed until discharge (reduces nursery transmission risks).

### Adolescent Immunization

-   HPV vaccine for girls aged 10–13.
-   Booster doses for waning childhood immunity (e.g., Tetanus).
-   Catch-up vaccination for missed/incomplete schedules.

### Pregnancy and Vaccination

-   Live viral vaccines generally avoided due to potential fetal risks.
-   Tdap recommended in the third trimester to protect against pertussis.

## Conclusion

Immunization remains a cornerstone of preventive healthcare, reducing the infectious disease burden
globally. Maintaining vaccine quality, storage protocols, and surveillance systems enhances safety
and efficacy. Addressing vaccine hesitancy, logistical challenges, and misinformation remains
crucial for improving immunization coverage. Future advancements, including next-generation
vaccines, aim to strengthen global disease prevention efforts. This detailed narrative is tailored
for a professional audience and integrates key immunization strategies, vaccine science, and best
practices in public health. Let me know if you need further elaboration on any aspect!

## Practical work

### Question

A 4-month-old baby is presented with fever, cough, and rhinorrhoea of 2 days duration. O/E:  Active,
healthy-looking child with occasional smiles; axillary temp 37.8 °C.  The baby is treated for the
common cold.  Baby has no scar over the Left deltoid area and on enquiry has visited the
immunization clinic two times since birth, but has misplaced the weighing card.

-   Which vaccinations will the child require at that age?
-   Which vaccinations are contraindicated?
-   Which ones should the child receive before going home?
-   When should the child be returned for follow-up vaccinations? And for which vaccines?
-   What if the baby’s mother is HIV-positive?
-   What if there is a parental history of SCD?

### Answers

The baby should have received several routine vaccinations at four months old according to Ghana’s
Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). Based on the standard schedule, the following vaccines are
typically required at this age:

**Vaccinations Required at Four Months**

-   Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) – Third dose
-   Pentavalent Vaccine (DPT/HiB/HepB) – Third dose (protects against diphtheria, pertussis,
    tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and hepatitis B)
-   Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) – Third dose
-   Rotavirus Vaccine – Second dose

**Contraindicated Vaccines**

-   Live vaccines such as BCG (for tuberculosis) and Measles-Rubella (MR) may be contraindicated if
    the child has certain immunodeficiencies, such as HIV/AIDS, or other medical conditions.
    However, specific contraindications should be assessed by a healthcare provider.

**Vaccines to Receive Before Going Home**

-   Since the baby has visited the immunization clinic only twice and has no visible BCG scar,
    verifying which vaccines have been missed is crucial. Before discharge, the baby should receive
    any missed doses of the routine vaccines, particularly BCG if it was not previously
    administered.

**Follow-up Vaccinations and Schedule**

The baby should return for the next scheduled vaccinations:

-   **At 6 months** – Vitamin A supplementation
-   **At 9 months** – Measles-Rubella (MR) and Yellow Fever vaccines
-   **At 12 months** – Meningococcal vaccine (Men A) and second dose of Measles-Rubella (MR)

**Considerations for Special Cases**

-   If the mother is HIV-positive: The baby may require additional monitoring and possible
    adjustments to the vaccination schedule. BCG may be contraindicated if the baby is symptomatic
    or severely immunocompromised.
-   If there is a parental history of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): The baby should be screened for
    sickle cell status. Additional precautions may be needed if diagnosed with SCD, including early
    pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines to prevent infections.
