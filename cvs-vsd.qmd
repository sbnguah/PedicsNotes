## Introduction

This is the most common Congenital Heart Disease (CHD), being seen in about 15-20% of all CHDs. VSD
occurs in different anatomical locations. The most common is the peri-membranous. Others are inlet,
outlet, muscular and infundibular. They also occur in different shapes and sizes as well.

## Pathophysiology

Typically VSD without the presence of another congenital heart malformation results in a left to
right ventricle shunting lesion because of the pressure difference. Thus, a VSD is usually an
acyanotic congenital heart lesion. This leads to a volume overload of the pulmonary artery, lungs,
left atrium and left ventricle. These chambers subsequently dilated. Pulmonary edema develops from
lung congestion leading to signs of heart failure.

Secondly, depending on the size of the defect the pressure in the left ventricle will get
transmitted to the right. How much pressure is transmitted depends on the size of the defect with
bigger defects transmitting more than smaller ones. This can result in increased right ventricular
pressure, and hypertrophy. It also worsens the pulmonary oedema already mentioned above.

Persistent pressure and volume overload cause remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in
permanent changes and pulmonary hypertension. When the pulmonary pressure rises significantly higher
than the systemic pressure, a reversal of the shunt results, leading to decreased oxygen saturation.

## Clinical presentation

The clinical presentation of VSDs is variable and depends on the size and position.

### Position

A perimembranous VSD of comparable size may exhibit more signs of heart failure compared to one that
is mid-muscular or apical.

### Size

Generally, the sizes of VSDs determine the extent of the volume and pressure overload of the right
heart and lungs. Larger ones result in relatively higher pressure and volume.

**Small**

Small VSDs are usually asymptomatic with no volume or pressure overload of the lung, pulmonary
artery and right heart.

**Moderate**

Some volume and pressure overload usually accompanies moderate-sized VSDs. They are thus often
accompanied by some heart failure and recurrent lower respiratory infections.

**Large**

Large defects are accompanied by severe volume and pressure overload. They present with persistent
heart failure and failure to thrive, exercise intolerance. when longstanding, they often end up with
significant pulmonary hypertension.
