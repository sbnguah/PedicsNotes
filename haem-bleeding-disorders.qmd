## **Introduction**

Bleeding disorders in children represent a unique and complex group of hematologic conditions that
pose significant diagnostic, therapeutic, and psychosocial challenges. From inherited conditions
like haemophilia and von Willebrand disease to acquired disorders related to liver disease, immune
dysfunction, or malignancy, the spectrum of bleeding disorders in the pediatric population is broad
and often under-recognised, especially in low-resource settings.

Early identification and appropriate management of bleeding disorders are critical in preventing
life-threatening complications, ensuring optimal physical development, and maintaining quality of
life. The pediatric context necessitates a holistic, family-centred approach that considers not only
the child’s medical needs but also the psychosocial impact on caregivers and families.

This section aims to provide a comprehensive yet practical guide to the diagnosis, evaluation, and
management of bleeding disorders in children. It integrates current scientific knowledge with
clinical experience and real-world considerations across diverse healthcare settings.

Furthermore, special emphasis is placed on challenges specific to resource-limited settings,
advances in gene therapy and personalised medicine, and the role of education and advocacy in
improving outcomes.

## **Hemostasis**  

The term [hemostasis](https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Thrombocytopenia:_Nursing) is coined from
“hem-”, which means “blood”, and “-stasis”, which means “to stop.” Hence, hemostasis is a
physiological process by which bleeding is stopped at the site of blood vessel injury. It represents
an interplay among blood vessel constriction, platelet plug formation, and blood coagulation through
fibrin clot formation. Hemostasis is essential for maintaining vascular integrity and preventing
haemorrhage. Blood clot formation at the wrong time or site within a blood vessel is termed
**Thrombosis,** and this is a pathological condition.

The normal hemostatic process requires a balance between procoagulants and anticoagulants. An
imbalance can lead to either excessive bleeding or unwanted clot formation.

### **Components of Hemostasis**

There are three (3) main components of haemostasis.

1.  Vascular constriction and platelet constriction form the primary haemostasis and lead to the
    formation of the platelet plug.
2.  The coagulation cascade initiates secondary haemostasis and leads to the formation of a fibrin
    clot.
3.  The last phase is fibrinolysis, which leads to clot breakdown and reestablishment of vessel
    patency.

### Coagulation Pathway (Secondary hemostasis)

The coagulation pathway is a sequence of enzymatic conversions of proenzymes into activated forms.
It consists of an intrinsic, extrinsic and a common pathway.

It is worth noting that the traditional model of this cascade, with its distinct intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways merging into a single pathway, is an oversimplification. In reality, that is in
vivo, these pathways likely activate each other simultaneously, creating a more complex and
interconnected system.

## **Bleeding Disorders**

Bleeding disorders, also known as bleeding diathesis, are various conditions characterised by
abnormalities in hemostasis that lead to abnormal bleeding. It mainly results from an imbalance in
hemostasis, with the balance tilting towards less procoagulants or increased anti-coagulant or
fibrinolytic activity.

**History**

Areas of emphasis.

-   Age of onset (helps distinguish between congenital and acquired disease)
-   Bleed (spontaneous or post-haemostatic challenge (HC) i.e., Trauma, surgery)
-   \*Location of bleed: umbilical stump bleed, bleeding post circumcision, epistaxis, gum bleed,
    haemarthrosis, menorrhagia, post-partum haemorrhage.
-   Transfusion history, including when the patient was last transfused.
-   Frequency and pattern of bleed (one site or multiple sites)
-   Drug history including herbs (aspirin, clopidogrel, tirofiban, etc)
-   Menstrual and obstetric history
-   Neonate: vit K injection
-   History of haemostatic challenge (surgery, dental work, injury)
-   Haemostatic measures given
-   Family history of abnormal bleeding (gender of affected relatives)
-   Other comorbidities: malignancy, liver disease, renal disease, etc
-   Inconsistent history (non-accidental injury)

\*May suggest the part of the haemostatic system affected; primary haemostasis often experiences
mucocutaneous bleeding, and secondary haemostasis has deep tissue bleeds, such as muscle and joint
bleeds

NB: At the end of history, these questions must be “why is my patient bleeding”? Will my patient
bleed after an HC? Could other family members be at risk of bleeding?

Any objective way to assess bleeding is with the BAT score (bleeding assessment tool), e.g., the
ISTH BAT.

**Physical examination**

Look out for these clinical features when examining the patient.

Dysmorphic features

Skin and mucosa (oral): petechiae, purpura, ecchymosis

Joint swelling and deformities

Significant lymphadenopathy

Organomegaly

Presence of haemangioma (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome)

### Screening tests

-   CBC: level of haemoglobin, Total WBC, differential WBC, Platelets
-   Liver function test
-   Coagulation tests: Prothrombin time (PT), Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT),
    fibrinogen assay, thrombin time (TT), clotting factor assays, platelet count
-   Specific tests: vWF antigen and vWF-Ristocetin cofactor activity, Platelet function analyser
    (not recommended)
