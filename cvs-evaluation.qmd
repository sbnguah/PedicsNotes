To fully evaluate a child with a suspected cardiac condition, one needs to go through the regular
steps applicable in medicine. These are outlined below:

## History

The history is traditionally divided into:

### Prenatal

Prenatally, the history should delve into but not be limited to the following:

1.  ***Infections***: Some infections are the well-known TORCHES. They include Toxoplasmosis, HIV,
    syphilis, parvovirus B19 (fifth disease), varicella (chickenpox) and (Zika), Rubella,
    Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus. Rubella, when acquired in the first trimester of
    pregnancy, is very well known to be associated with [PDA](cvs-pda.qmd)s.
2.  ***Medications:*** The use of some medications, including herbs, predisposes to heart disease in
    newborns. Anticonvulsant such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are highly
    teratogenic.[@Kalisch-Smith2020]
3.  ***Recreational drugs***: Excessive smoking, cocaine, and alcohol use in early pregnancy are all
    associated with teratogenic effects on the heart.
4.  ***Maternal illnesses:*** Maternal medical conditions during pregnancy may be associated with
    heart diseases in their fetuses. Diabetes mellitus is particularly well known, predisposing to
    hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, d-Transposition of the Great Arteries, etc. Autoimmune conditions
    such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus may also predispose to rhythm disturbances in the fetus and
    child, even when the mother is not symptomatic.
5.  ***Family history of CHD***: The recurrence of CHD in first-degree relatives varies but is
    almost always higher than in the rest of the population. For instance, having a first-degree
    relation with a cornoventricular defect is associated with a recurrence risk ratio of 24.3 (95%
    CI,12.2 to 48.7), 7.1 (95% CI, 4.5 to 11.1) for isolated [Atrial Septal Defect](cvs-asd.qmd),
    and 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.3) for isolated [Ventricular Septal Defect](cvs-vsd.qmd).[@Ã¸yen2009]

### Perinatal

Perinatal history associated with heart disease may include the following:

1.  ***Birth weight***: A high birth weight, often associated with a child of a diabetic mother, is
    also associated with an increased incidence of CHDs. Conversely, a low birth weight may also be
    associated with fetal alcohol syndrome or congenital rubella syndrome, both of which are
    associated with CHDs.
2.  ***Newborn resuscitation***: Some critical CHDs can be similar to neonatal asphyxia in a
    newborn, thus requiring resuscitation.

### After birth

Ascertaining history after birth is the most extensive. Many of these are directed to the features
of heart failure. These include:

1.  ***Growth failure***: Poor weight gain is a very prominent feature of CHDs in children. Many
    clinically significant CHDs result in poor feeding, chronic metabolic demand on the patient and
    poor oxygenation in cyanotic CHDs. All these result in increased caloric demand, resulting in
    poor growth.
2.  ***Cyanotic spells***: Some cyanotic CHDs are associated with recurrent periods where the child
    has increasing cyanosis, sometimes associated with weakness, fast breathing and even
    unconsciousness. The presence of these spells may be a pointer to a CHD.
3.  ***Squatting and exercise intolerance***: Exercise intolerance is a common presentation of heart
    disease in children. However, for some cyanotic congenital heart diseases, most notably
    [Tetralogy of Fallot](cvs-tof.qmd), the added feature is frequent squatting when the child
    becomes fatigued.
4.  ***Delayed milestones***: Growth failure, easy fatiguability, and other genetic syndromes may
    delay motor milestones in children.
5.  ***Others***: *Fast* and sometimes *difficult breathing* are also common presentations of CHDs.
    Some children develop *oedema*.(@fig-cvs-pedal-edema) This is predominantly seen in younger
    children's faces and older children's feet. Frequent *lower respiratory infection* is also seen
    in children with heart diseases, especially those associated with [heart
    failure](cvs-heart-failure.qmd).
6.  ***Uncommon symptoms***: Uncommon presentation of heart disease in children include:
    -   *Chest pain* is a rather feared symptom in adults but usually portends another diagnosis
        rather than heart disease in children.
    -   *Syncope* can be observed in children with an arrhythmia or left or right ventricular
        obstruction. However, this is still not a common presentation in pediatric heart diseases.
    -   Older children report *palpitations*.
    -   *Joint swelling* does occur in Rheumatic Heart Disease, but again, it is not a common
        presentation in children with heart pathology.

## Clinical examination

### General

Clinical examination for a child with a suspected heart disease should always start as general. One
should first look out for life-threatening signs and intervene quickly. Subsequent steps could
include:

1.  ***Nutritional status*** is vital as many children with chronic heart conditions with
    significant heart failure present with malnutrition. The growth pattern of the patient should
    always be evaluated.

2.  ***Dysmorphism*** is very critical in pediatric heart diseases. As much as 23% of all children
    with CHD will have a chromosomal abnormality.[@wang2023] There are many genetic syndromes with
    well-documented recognisable heart defects. Below are just a few adapted from @ko2015:

::: {#tbl-genetic-synds}
| Genetic syndrome | \% with CHD | Cardiac anomalies |
|----|----|----|
| [Down Syndrome](synd-down.qmd) | 40 to 50 | Atrial Septal Defect, Ventricular Septal Defect, Atrioventricular Canal Defect, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot |
| [Turner's syndrome](synd-turners.qmd) | 25 to 45 | Coarctation of the Aorta. Bicuspid Aortic Valve, Aortic Stenosis, Hypoplastic left heart syndrome |
| [DiGeorge syndrome](synd-digeorge.qmd) | 70 to 75 | Aortic arch anomalies, Truncus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Fallot |
| [William's syndrome](synd-williams.qmd) | 75 to 80 | Supravalvar Aortic Stenosis, Peripheral Pulmonary Stenosis |
| [Noonan syndrome](synd-noonan.qmd) | 70 to 80 | Pulmonary Stenosis, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Atrial Septal Defect |
| Kabuki syndrome | 31 to 55 | Coarctation of the Aorta, Atrial Septal Defect, Aortic Stenosis, Mitral Stenosis, Hypoplastic left heart syndrome |
| Alagille syndrome | 90 | Peripheral Pulmonary Stenosis, Pulmonary Stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot |

3.  ***Colour***: The skin colour of a child with a CHD could hold signs of its presence.
    *Cyanosis*, the blueish duskiness of the skin and mucous membranes can be seen in children with
    cyanotic congenital heart disease. This may not be easy on black skin and can only be observed
    in the mouth and tongue (@fig-cvsCyanosisMouth). Mild cyanosis is often not visible and may
    require pulse oximetry. *Pallor* can be observed in patients with heart diseases, such as
    [Infective Endocarditis](cvs-inf-endo.qmd). *Jaundice* can be observed in patients with
    [Infective Endocarditis](cvs-inf-endo.qmd) or those with hepatic injury secondary to chronic
    [heart failure](cvs-heart-failure.qmd).

![Cyanosis in the tongue of a
child](images/cvs-cyanosis-mouth.jpg){#fig-cvsCyanosisMouth fig-align="center"}

4.  ***Clubbing***: All four stages of digital clubbing are seen in children with cyanotic CHD or
    [Infective Endocarditis](cvs-inf-endo.qmd). (@fig-cvsFingerClubbing) Note that some cases of
    finger clubbing may be familial.

![Finger clubbing](images/cvs_finger_clubbing.jpg){#fig-cvsFingerClubbing
fig-align="center"}

5.  ***Respiratory signs***: Respiratory signs commonly associated with heart diseases in children
    are *tachypnoea*, *dyspnoea*, *chest recessions,* and *increased work of breathing*. These are
    especially true when there is associated [heart failure](cvs-heart-failure.qmd), which worsens
    with exercise or breastfeeding infants.
6.  ***Circulation***: The circulation in a child with a suspected heart disease is critical.
    Reduced circulation can be assessed with the warmth of the extremities, capillary refill time,
    and blood pressure.
7.  ***Blood pressure***: Low blood pressure is a late sign of circulatory failure and cardiogenic
    shock. Conversely, weak pulse may be associated with hypertensive heart disease as well. Wide
    pulse pressure, an abnormally wide difference between the systolic and diastolic blood
    pressures, may indicate a [patent ductus arteriosus](cvs-pda.qmd), aortic insufficiency or an
    aorticopulmonary window. Blood pressure should be checked in the upper and lower limbs as a
    higher BP in the upper limbs compared to the lower may indicate the presence of a [Coarctation
    of the Aorta](cvs-coa.qmd).
8.  ***Pulses***: The radial pulse is the most routinely examined in cardiovascular examination. It
    should be checked for the rate, rhythm, volume and character. If they are difficult to examine,
    especially in young infants, the brachial pulsus can be used. Other pulses should be examined,
    including the brachial femoral and dorsalis pedis. Next, the synchronisation of the
    radio-femoral pulse should be determined for a delay. This happens in the coarctation of the
    aorta. Pulses that are challenging to palpate or inconsistent could be caused by large artery
    arteritis, such as Taksyasu's arteritis.

### Precordial

1.  ***Inspection***: Inspection of the precordium yields a wealth of information in a child with a
    suspected heart disease. A midline bulge or left-sided bulge will often indicate a right or
    left-sided heart chamber dilatation. Visible precordial pulsation should be noted. Scars,
    especially from previous surgeries, are useful. Scarification, the usually small "medicinal"
    scars done on the chest as a means of treatment, should also be noted. A Harrison sulcus,
    depression of the lower part of the chest, is common in children with chronic heart failure and,
    thus, dyspnoea. @fig-chest-bulge

![Chest bulge and Harrison's sulcus in
child](images/cvs-chest-bulge.jpg){#fig-chest-bulge fig-align="center"}

2.  ***Palpation***: Palpation should be directed toward determining the presence of a thrill (a
    palpable murmur) heave at the apex or middle of the precordium. Also, a palpable heart sound,
    especially the second at the upper left sternal edge, may indicate pulmonary hypertension.

3.  ***Percussion***: This is of very little relevance in examining the heart in children.

4.  ***Auscultation***: Auscultation of the heart can yield a wealth of information. It should be
    done in a quiet environment, with the child as calm as possible. Auscultating can be performed
    with both bell and diaphragm. All four auscultatory areas need to be auscultated. Auscultating
    the back (between the scapulae) and over the carotids is always prudent. First, the regular two
    heart sounds should be determined. If muffled, they could indicate a pericardial effusion or
    sometimes obesity. Pulmonary hypertension and an [Atrial Septal Defect](cvs-asd.qmd), for
    instance could result in a loud or split-second heart sound. The presence of a third heart sound
    (S3) is not always pathologic in children, but an S4 is. The presence of a murmur needs to be
    determined. If present, it should be determined if it is systolic or diastolic and the point of
    maximal intensity. It needs to be graded (@tbl-murmur-grades), and the presence of radiation
    must be ascertained. @tbl-murmur-location indicates types of murmurs, their location and likely
    heart diseases. Diastolic murmurs are difficult to appreciate for the average medical student
    but may be present in aortic regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation, and at the cardiac apex in
    cases of [heart failure](cvs-heart-failure.qmd) secondary to a large left-to-right shunt.
    Notably, approximately 80% of murmurs in children can be categorised as "innocent murmurs" as
    they are not associated with cardiac pathology.

    Other sounds need to be evaluated as well. These may include a pericardial rub, which occurs in
    pericarditis, an ejection click heart in early systole and cases of aortic or pulmonary
    stenosis.

## Investigation

Various investigations used in the diagnosis and management of heart diseases are:

1.  ***Pulse Oximetry***: Pulse oximetry helps determine heart rate and oxygen saturation. An oxygen
    saturation lower than expected (\<95% outside the early neonatal period) is considered abnormal
    and a strong indication of cyanotic heart disease in the presence of a non-pathologic lung.

2.  ***Electrocardiogram***: The electrocardiogram is a common modality for the bedside
    investigation of heart diseases in all age groups. It indicates the heart rate, rhythm, chamber
    dilatation, wall thickness, laterality of the chambers, electrolyte abnormalities and even the
    presence of a head injury. It is often not conclusive in many heart conditions but serves as a
    good auxiliary test in children, especially post-surgery. There are various types: The routine
    ECG takes just a few minutes to perform on a resting patient, usually lying supine. On the other
    hand, the stress ECG is traditionally done with the heart under stress, as may happen during an
    aerobic exercise. The Holter ECG, on the other hand, is attached to the patient and continuously
    monitors the heart for 24 to 48 hours. This usually gives a better reflection of the heart's
    electrical activity over a prolonged period instead of just a brief period.

3.  ***X-ray***: A chest x-ray is very useful in diagnosing and managing heart diseases in children.
    Fortunately, it is readily available in many parts of Ghana. Both posteroanterior and lateral
    chest X-rays can be useful in assessing the individual chamber and overall heart sizes.
    Cardiomegaly, assessed with a cardiothoracic ratio \> 60% in children, is seen in many cases of
    heart disease. Chest X-rays also indicate ling pathologies, often showing as opacification or
    silhouetting. Increased lung markings, for instance, can be found in patients with VSD and ASD,
    while decreased lung markings are often seen in the [Tetralogy of Fallot](cvs-tof.qmd) and
    pulmonary stenosis. The shape of the heart is often an indicator of the underlying cardiac
    pathology. A Boot-shaped heart may indicate a [Tetraloy of Fallot](cvs-tof.qmd)
    (@fig-cvs-x-ray-boot-shaped), while a globular-shaped heart points to dilated cardiomyopathy or
    pericardial effusion. @fig-cvs-globular-heart

fig-align="center"}

4.  ***Echocardiogram***: This is a rather old but new investigatory modality. It is old because it
    has been around since the 1960s and new because it is relatively new in Ghana. It is, however, a
    beneficial modality of investigation. An echocardiogram is essentially an ultrasound of the
    heart and great vessels. Its most significant advantage is its ability to visualise the heart in
    real-time, assess systolic and diastolic functions, measure chamber sizes and wall thickness,
    detect defects such as ventricular septal defect, determine valvular abnormalities such as
    stenosis and regurgitation, and even assess all these under stressful situation (stress
    echocardiogram). The video below illustrates the various echocardiographic views used in
    children. Unfortunately, since it is very user-dependent, it is not commonly available in Ghana,
    with pediatric echocardiography only currently available in Accra, Kumasi, Cape Coast and
    Tamale.

5.  ***Computerised tomography (CT) scan and Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI)***: These are more
    advanced modalities available for use, especially when an echocardiogram is inconclusive or
    further study of the patient is necessary. A CT scan generates the image using a series of
    X-rays taken at different angles without the complication of significant X-ray radiation
    exposure. Both modalities can employ contrast to delineate vessels.

6.  ***Others***: Other specialised investigatory modalities are used as required, including cardiac
    catheterisation in a specialised catheter laboratory.
