## Definition
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a form of chronic lung disease that affects newborns, especially those born prematurely and requiring oxygen therapy. It results in damage to the lungs and airways, causing tissue destruction in the tiny air sacs of the lung1. While most infants recover from BPD, some may have long-term breathing difficulties.
