## Introduction

Parasitic infections remain a major public health concern in the tropics, particularly in **Ghana**
and the wider **sub-Saharan African region**, where they significantly contribute to morbidity and
mortality among children. These infections are closely linked to environmental, socioeconomic, and
behavioural factors such as poverty, inadequate sanitation, unsafe water supply, and limited access
to healthcare.

In paediatric practice, parasitic diseases commonly present as **anaemia**, **malnutrition**,
**growth failure**, **diarrhoea**, and **neurological complications**, often exacerbating other
ongoing health conditions. Understanding the basic biology, classification, and epidemiology of
parasites is crucial for diagnosis, treatment, and preventive interventions in endemic areas.

This chapter provides an overview of parasitic infections, defines key concepts, and discusses the
classification, modes of transmission, and epidemiological patterns with specific reference to Ghana
and sub-Saharan Africa.

## Basic Definitions

A **parasite** is an organism that lives on or within another living organism, known as the
**host**, deriving benefit at the host’s expense. The relationship is typically one-sided, with the
parasite gaining nourishment, shelter, or other support while causing harm or disease to the host.

### Key Terminologies

-   **Host:** The organism that harbours the parasite.

    -   *Definitive host* – harbours the adult or sexually mature stage.\
    -   *Intermediate host* – harbours the larval or asexual stage.\
    -   *Paratenic (transport) host* – carries the parasite without further development.

-   **Vector:** An organism, often an arthropod (e.g., mosquito, tsetse fly), that transmits the
    parasite from one host to another.

-   **Reservoir host:** Animals that harbour parasites infectious to humans, maintaining the life
    cycle in nature.

-   **Infection vs. Infestation:**

    -   *Infection* refers to internal invasion by protozoa or helminths.\
    -   *Infestation* refers to external colonization by ectoparasites (e.g., lice, ticks, mites).

-   **Endoparasites** live inside the host’s body (e.g., *Plasmodium*, *Ascaris lumbricoides*),
    while **ectoparasites** live on the host’s body surface (e.g., *Pediculus humanus capitis*).

Parasites have evolved to coexist with their hosts, but in humans—especially in young or
malnourished children—these relationships often result in overt disease.

## Classification of Parasites

Parasites of medical importance are broadly classified into three groups: **protozoa**,
**helminths**, and **arthropods**.

### Protozoa

Protozoa are **unicellular microscopic organisms** that reproduce by binary fission or multiple
fission. Many are motile and can survive in host tissues or extracellular fluids. They are
responsible for some of the most severe parasitic diseases in children.

#### Major Groups of Protozoa

| Group | Locomotory Organ | Example | Disease |
|----|----|----|----|
| Amoebae | Pseudopodia | *Entamoeba histolytica* | Amoebic dysentery, liver abscess |
| Flagellates | Flagella | *Giardia lamblia*, *Trypanosoma brucei*, *Leishmania donovani* | Giardiasis, African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis |
| Ciliates | Cilia | *Balantidium coli* | Balantidiasis |
| Sporozoa | None (complex life cycle) | *Plasmodium spp.*, *Toxoplasma gondii*, *Cryptosporidium spp.* | Malaria, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis |

#### Clinical Relevance in Ghana

In Ghana, **malaria**, caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, is by far the most important protozoal
infection. It accounts for a significant proportion of outpatient visits and hospital admissions in
children, with high mortality if untreated. Other protozoal infections such as **giardiasis** and
**cryptosporidiosis** are increasingly recognized as causes of **persistent diarrhoea** in both
immunocompetent and immunocompromised children, including those with HIV infection.

### Helminths

Helminths are **multicellular worms** that infect various tissues and organs. They are typically
large enough to be seen with the naked eye and are classified into three main groups: nematodes,
cestodes, and trematodes.

#### Nematodes – Roundworms

These are cylindrical worms with separate sexes.

**Examples:** - *Ascaris lumbricoides* (roundworm) - *Ancylostoma duodenale* and *Necator
americanus* (hookworms) - *Trichuris trichiura* (whipworm) - *Strongyloides stercoralis* -
*Enterobius vermicularis* (pinworm)

**Clinical relevance:** In Ghana, soil-transmitted helminth infections remain endemic in many rural
areas, contributing to chronic anaemia, malnutrition, and impaired cognitive development among
school-aged children.

#### Cestodes – Tapeworms

These are flat, ribbon-like worms with segmented bodies called **proglottids**.

**Examples:** - *Taenia saginata* (beef tapeworm) - *Taenia solium* (pork tapeworm) -
*Diphyllobothrium latum* (fish tapeworm) - *Hymenolepis nana* (dwarf tapeworm)

**Clinical relevance:** Tapeworm infections are relatively uncommon in Ghana compared to nematodes,
but *Taenia solium* poses a risk of **neurocysticercosis**, an emerging cause of seizures in
children and adults.

#### Trematodes – Flukes

These are leaf-shaped flatworms that require at least one intermediate host (usually a snail).

**Examples:** - *Schistosoma haematobium* – urinary schistosomiasis - *Schistosoma mansoni* –
intestinal schistosomiasis

**Clinical relevance:** Schistosomiasis remains endemic in the **Volta Basin**, **northern Ghana**,
and other water-rich communities. In children, it leads to **haematuria**, **hepatosplenomegaly**,
**anaemia**, and **growth retardation**.

### Arthropods

Arthropods are **invertebrates with jointed appendages** and chitinous exoskeletons. They are
important as **vectors**, **intermediate hosts**, or **direct causes** of disease through bites,
stings, or infestation.

#### Common Arthropods in Medical Practice

| Group | Example | Role in Disease |
|----|----|----|
| Mosquitoes | *Anopheles*, *Aedes*, *Culex* | Vectors of malaria, filariasis, dengue |
| Tsetse flies | *Glossina spp.* | Vector of African trypanosomiasis |
| Sandflies | *Phlebotomus spp.* | Vector of leishmaniasis |
| Blackflies | *Simulium spp.* | Vector of onchocerciasis |
| Fleas, lice, ticks, mites | Various species | Ectoparasitic infestations; vectors of typhus, rickettsial infections |

In Ghana, **malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes** are the most significant arthropod vector,
while **blackflies** are responsible for **onchocerciasis** (river blindness) in some riverine
communities.

## Modes of Transmission of Parasitic Infections

Parasites employ diverse routes to infect humans. Understanding these is crucial for preventive
strategies.

1.  **Faeco–oral transmission** – ingestion of cysts, oocysts, or eggs from contaminated water or
    food (*E. histolytica*, *Giardia lamblia*, *Ascaris lumbricoides*).
2.  **Vector-borne transmission** – via arthropods such as mosquitoes, tsetse flies, and sandflies
    (*Plasmodium*, *Trypanosoma*, *Leishmania*).
3.  **Skin penetration** – infective larvae penetrate intact skin (*Schistosoma*, hookworms,
    *Strongyloides*).
4.  **Transplacental or perinatal transmission** – *Toxoplasma gondii*, *Trypanosoma cruzi*.
5.  **Ingestion of undercooked meat or fish** – *Taenia*, *Trichinella*, *Diphyllobothrium*.
6.  **Person-to-person contact or fomites** – *Enterobius vermicularis*, lice, scabies.

In Ghana, the **faeco-oral route** and **vector-borne transmission** dominate, reflecting poor
sanitation and high vector density due to favourable climatic conditions.

## Epidemiology of Parasitic Infections in Ghana and Sub-Saharan Africa

### Burden and Impact

Parasitic infections constitute one of the **most widespread causes of childhood morbidity** in
sub-Saharan Africa. They coexist with malnutrition, anaemia, and chronic infections like
tuberculosis and HIV, creating a vicious cycle of ill health and poor development.

In Ghana, the **Ghana Health Service (GHS)** and **Neglected Tropical Disease Control Programme**
have prioritized the control of malaria, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted
helminths through **mass drug administration**, **insecticide-treated nets**, and **health
education**.

### Key Epidemiological Highlights

| Disease | Agent | Mode of Transmission | Epidemiology in Ghana |
|----|----|----|----|
| Malaria | *Plasmodium falciparum* | Bite of female *Anopheles* mosquito | Endemic nationwide, seasonal peaks during rains |
| Schistosomiasis | *S. haematobium*, *S. mansoni* | Skin penetration in infested water | Endemic in Volta, Northern, and Ashanti regions |
| Soil-transmitted helminths | *Ascaris*, *Trichuris*, *Hookworm* | Faeco-oral or skin penetration | Common in school-aged children in rural areas |
| Onchocerciasis | *Onchocerca volvulus* | Blackfly bite | Focal along river basins |
| Filariasis | *Wuchereria bancrofti* | Mosquito bite | Endemic in parts of Northern Ghana |

## Control and Prevention Strategies

Effective control requires **multisectoral interventions** integrating health, water, sanitation,
and education systems.

1.  **Environmental sanitation:** Proper disposal of faeces, improved water supply, and waste
    management.
2.  **Vector control:** Use of insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and
    elimination of vector breeding sites.
3.  **Mass drug administration (MDA):** Periodic deworming with albendazole, praziquantel, and
    ivermectin under the Ghana NTD programme.
4.  **Health education:** Promoting hand hygiene, safe food practices, and community awareness.
5.  **Nutrition support:** Addressing micronutrient deficiencies to reduce susceptibility to
    infection.
6.  **Surveillance and research:** Strengthening laboratory capacity and epidemiological monitoring,
    especially in children.

## Summary

Parasitic infections remain a significant public health challenge in Ghana and across sub-Saharan
Africa, with children being the most vulnerable group. Understanding their biology, modes of
transmission, and epidemiological context is essential for effective prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment.\
Sustained control will require continued investment in sanitation, health education, and access to
quality paediatric care.
