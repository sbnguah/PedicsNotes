## Anatomy

The heart is located in the mediastinum of the chest, bounded anteriorly by the sternum, posteriorly
by the spine and laterally by the lungs. Externally, the right ventricle is anterior. Most of the
left ventricle, left atrium and right atrium are posterior. internally the right and left atria are
separated by the tricuspid and mitral valves respectively. The arterial supply of the heart is
through the coronary arteries while venous drainage is through the coronary sinus. The aorta and
pulmonary arteries arise from the left and right ventricles. The heart has three layers:

1.  Endocardium: Inner epithelial layer of the heart
2.  Myocardium: Muscular part of the heart
3.  Pericardium: Outer layers of the heart. Divided into the visceral and parietal pericardium.

Venous blood enters the right atrium through the inferior and superior vena cavae. It empties in
atrial systole into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. It then moves on through the
pulmonary valve in ventricular systole, to the pulmonary artery and the the lungs. Blood returning
from the lungs enters the right atrium through the four pulmonary veins. In atrial systole, it moves
onto the left ventricle through the mitral valve. Finally, it empties into the aorta through the
aortic valve.

The heart has an inherent electrical system that automatically depolarises it. The parts are:

1.  The SinoAtrial (SA) node: This is the pacemaker of the heart and depolarises the two atria.
2.  AtrioVentricular (AV) node: Receives impulses from the SA node, delays a bit before propagating
    it further
3.  His-purkinje fibre system. Responsible for the spread of electrical impulses to the ventricles

## **Heart as a pump**

There is a difference in the pumping action of the heart in utero and after birth.

1.  Fetal
    -   Most work is done by the Right ventricle
    -   The right Ventricle is therefore relatively hypertrophic
    -   Only 15% of the cardiac output is pumped into the lungs
2.  After birth
    -   Gradual transition to Left ventricle dominance
    -   Gradual fall in pulmonary pressure (over 6 weeks)
    -   The left ventricle does most of the work and becomes thicker than the right

## **Systolic and diastolic functions**

*Systole*: This is the contractile phase of the heart. It starts with the atrium so it empties into
the ventricles before the ventricle's subsequent contract.

*Diastole*: This is the relaxation phase where the heart relaxes and lets in blood. It also starts
with the atrium and then the ventricles.

*Compliance*: This describes how easily the heart chamber relaxes in response to the inflow of
blood.

## **Cardiac Pressures**

The pressures in the heart vary for different ages and individuals. Generally, the pressure in the
atria is lower than that in the ventricles. Also, the pea systolic pressure in the left ventricle is
higher than in the right. The diastolic pressure in the left ventricle is however lower than the
right ventricle. In the typical adult heart, the following pressures are often observed. Also, both
systolic and diastolic pressure in the aorta is higher than that in the pulmonary artery.

Systolic pressure in general is generated by the ventricles. In conditions such as coarctation of
the aorta, aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, the ventricles end up increasing their
workload to generate enough pressure. The diastolic pressure on the other hand is maintained by the
closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Thus incompetent pulmonary or aortic valve leads to a
decrease in diastolic pressure in the the tow vessels respectively.
