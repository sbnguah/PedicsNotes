## Introduction

The term seizure vaguely refers to anything that “seizes” or “takes hold” of a person. These may be
epileptic or non-epileptic events. In this chapter, unless otherwise specified, the term seizure is
used to refer to epileptic events.

## Definitions

### Seizures

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines epileptic seizure as a *transient
occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal, excessive, or synchronous neuronal activity in
the brain.* These may manifest as paroxysmal motor, sensory, autonomic, and/or behavioral or
cognitive function abnormalities or impaired consciousness.

### Convulsions

These are the motor manifestations of a seizure. These include tonic (stiffening), clonic (jerking),
myoclonic (massive jerking), vibratory (trembling), or hypermotor (thrashing about). Seizures with
no motor manifestations are termed non-convulsive and include motor arrest, e.g., unresponsive stare
or drop attacks. Sensory disturbances during a seizure may include visual, auditory, or tactile
disturbances. Some patients may describe changes in smell or taste.

Non-epileptic seizures in children include many events such as cardiac syncope, vasovagal syncope,
breath-holding spells, infantile gratification, shuddering spells, etc. These are sometimes referred
to as seizure mimics.

## Classification of Seizures

The ILAE published its most recent classification of seizures in 2017. In this classification,
seizures are broadly classified based on their onset within the brain as focal, generalized, or
unknown onset.

-   Focal-onset seizures originate from a focus within one hemisphere.
-   Generalized-onset seizures originate from both hemispheres.
-   Unknown onset – where the onset is not known at the time of the evaluation.

**Focal-onset seizures** (previously known as partial seizures) are further subclassified based on
whether awareness is preserved or lost during the seizure and secondary generalization.

-   Focal seizures with intact awareness (or focal aware seizures): These are focal seizures in
    which awareness is preserved. This was previously known as simple partial seizures.
-   Focal seizures with loss of awareness (or focal unaware seizures): These are focal seizures in
    which awareness is lost during the event. They were previously referred to as complex partial
    seizures.
-   Focal seizures evolving into bilateral tonic-clonic seizures: These are focal seizures that go
    on to become generalized. They were previously referred to as focal seizures with secondary
    generalization.

**Generalised-onset seizures** are further subclassified based on their manifestations as:

-   Clonic seizures: having repetitive jerky movements.
-   Tonic seizures: characterised by increased tone.
-   Tonic-clonic seizures: They have two phases: a tonic phase and a clonic phase.
-   Tonic-clonic-tonic, or other combinations
-   Atonic seizures: These are characterized by loss of muscle tone, leading to drop attacks.
-   Myoclonic seizures: These are characterized by sudden jerks of a group of muscles.
-   Absence seizures: These are characterized by blank stares during which the patient loses
    awareness. They may be associated with lip-smacking or eyelid fluttering. A typical absence
    seizure starts abruptly, lasts about 5-15 seconds, and ends abruptly with no postictal events.
    An atypical absence may last \>15 seconds or may have a slow recovery. 
-   Epileptic spasms: These are characterized by repetitive flexor (or extensor) jerks of the limbs
    and trunk, occurring in clusters.

## Febrile seizures

### Definition

A febrile seizure is accompanied by fever in a child aged 6 months to 6 years without intracranial
infection/inflammation \[ref\]. It affects about 3% of all children between 6 months and 6 years
old.

Biological Basis

The exact mechanism leading to febrile seizures is not clearly understood; biology is related to the
immature brain in young children, fever, and genetic predisposition. The fever activates the
cytokine networks (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta), increasing neuronal excitability. There is a complex
inheritance involving multiple genes and environmental factors for children with genetic
predisposition. Monozygotic twins have a higher concordance rate than dizygotic twins.

The risk for a first febrile seizure in a child is increased in those with

-   Delayed neonatal hospital discharge
-   Slow neurological development as judged by the parent
-   Family history of febrile seizures (especially in a first-degree relative)
-   Attendance at day care

### Etiology

Common causes of febrile seizures include malaria, URTI, otitis media, pharyngitis, transient viral
infections, and gastroenteritis. Some children develop a fever following vaccination with whole-cell
DPT or measles vaccine.

### Classification

Febrile seizures are classified as simple or complex. @tbl-simple-complex-seizure below shows the
differences between simple and complex febrile seizures.

::: {#tbl-simple-complex-seizure}
| Feature            | Simple febrile seizure                    | Complex febrile seizure               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Seizure type       | Generalized                               | Maybe focal                           |
| Duration           | Brief (\<15 min)                          | Prolonged                             |
| Number of episodes | Single episode during the febrile illness | Repeated episodes in the same illness |
| Outcomes           | Do not cause brain damage                 | Increased risk of brain damage        |

: Simple versus Complex Febrile Seizures
:::

### Risk of recurrence

In children with febrile seizures, the risk factors for recurrence are

-   Young age at the time of the first febrile seizure (\< 15 months)
-   Family history of febrile seizures (first-degree relative)
-   Low temperature at the time of the seizure (\< 40 degrees)
-   Short duration of illness before the seizure          \[Berg et al, 1997\]

Having a complex febrile seizure and neurologic dysfunction are not consistent predictors of
recurrence.

### Risk of subsequent epilepsy

The risk of epilepsy in children with febrile seizures is slightly higher than the incidence in the
general population. The risk is increased with:

-   Complex febrile seizures (focal, prolonged, repeated within a single illness)
-   Developmental delay or neurologic dysfunction
-   Family history of epilepsy                                                                     

The number of febrile seizures is not a predictor of subsequent epilepsy.

### Long-term cognitive and behavioural outcomes

Febrile seizures are “benign”. Studies have shown that children with febrile seizures have the same
academic progress, intellect, and behaviour as other children.  

## Acute scenarios: prolonged seizures versus status epilepticus

### Definitions:

**Prolonged seizures:** Most convulsive seizures in children are brief (lasting \< 3 minutes).
However, some may go on beyond 5 minutes. These are termed prolonged seizures.

**Status epilepticus**, on the other hand, is a prolonged seizure lasting more than 30 minutes or
multiple seizures without recovery of consciousness. This definition applies to convulsive seizures.
The duration of non-convulsive seizures differs based on the seizure type.

### Pathophysiology of status epilepticus

In the initial seizure phase, the body undergoes autoregulation, leading to increased heart rate,
cardiac output, and cerebral perfusion. This ensures that there is increased oxygen and glucose
delivery to the brain. Also, increased cerebral perfusion helps remove carbon dioxide and metabolic
waste, which build up in the brain during seizures. Beyond 30 minutes, this autoregulation breaks
down, reducing cardiac output, decreasing systemic blood pressure, and decreasing cerebral
perfusion. In the end, there is decreased oxygenation (hypoxia) and buildup of metabolic waste,
which trigger a cascade of events with resultant neuronal deaths. This is why it is essential to
stop any seizure from progressing into a status epilepticus.

![Timing of seizures in the acute scenario and the clinical
implications](images/neu-seizure-timing.jpg){#fig-SeizureTiming
fig-align="center"}

### The Do’s and Don’ts in acute scenarios

In the first few minutes of a seizure, it is essential to undertake basic first aid measures to
protect the patient. These are termed the **Do’s** and include:

-   Protect the person from injury (eg, remove harmful objects from nearby, cushion their heads,
    etc.)

-   When the seizure is over, gently place the patient in recovery. This positioning aids breathing
    by ensuring the patient does not choke on their secretions.

-   Stay with the patient until the seizure is over.

-   Stay calm and reassuring.

Some traditional practices can be harmful and should be discouraged. These are referred to as the
**Don’ts** and include:

-   Do not restrain the person’s movements. Forcefully restraining their movement does not stop the
    seizures and may instead result in needless injuries like fractures and dislocations. 

-   Do not put anything in their mouth. This could lead to the patient biting on the spoon or
    spatula and causing damage to their teeth, gums, or palate. Also, please do not put your finger
    in their mouth. A forceful bite on your figure can lead to severe injuries, including
    amputation.

-   Do not try to move them unless they are in danger.

-   Do not give them anything to eat or drink until they fully recover.

-   Do not attempt to bring them around. Practices such as pouring cold water on the patient,
    smearing them with garlic or other noxious substances are harmful and do not stop the seizures. 

**Indications for bringing the patient to the emergency room** include:

1.  If this is the person’s first seizure.

2.  If the seizure continues for more than five minutes.

3.  If one seizure follows another without the person regaining consciousness between seizures.

4.  If the person is injured.

5.  If you believe the person needs urgent medical attention.

### General principles of management of Prolonged Seizures and Status Epilepticus

In the first 5 minutes, critical interventions should include:

-   General emergency measures including

    -   A = airway
    -   B = breathing
    -   C = circulation
    -   D = disability (such as hypoglycemia)
    -   E = exposure

-   Check blood glucose and correct hypoglycemia, if present.

-   Remember the Do’s and Don’ts.

If the seizure persists after 5 minutes, initiate drug management.

-   1^st^ line drugs are benzodiazepines: these commonly include diazepam (rectal/IV, midazolam
    (buccal/nasal), and lorazepam (IV/rectal). These may be repeated after 10 minutes if the seizure
    persists.
-   2^nd^ line drugs include phenobarbital (IV), phenytoin (IV), valproate (IV), or levetiracetam
    (IV).
-   3^rd^ line drugs include anesthetic agents and should be given in the intensive care unit or in
    a center where the patient’s breathing can be supported. They include thiopentone, propofol, and
    ketamine. Alternatively, continuous infusions of midazolam or repeated intravenous boluses of
    phenobarbitone may be used.

This stepwise approach to the management of ongoing seizures is illustrated in Table 2 below:

: Stepwise approach to status epilepticus
:::

### Prognosis of Status Epilepticus in Children

In patients who present with convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), there is a mortality rate of 3-9%
within 30 days of the CSE. The mortality rate is worse in low- and middle-income countries.

In those who survive, the neurological sequelae depend on the type and duration of the seizure, the
patient's age, and the underlying etiology.

-   Duration of the SE – the single most important determinant of prognosis. Worse outcome for
    prolonged SE.
-   Age – worse neurological sequelae in infants (30% vs. 6% in older children)
-   Seizure type – worse outcome for convulsive SE
-   Underlying etiology

## Epilepsy

### Definition:

Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions:

a.  At least two unprovoked seizures occurring \>24 hours apart.
b.  One unprovoked seizure and an increased probability of further seizures
c.  Diagnosis of an epileptic syndrome

It affects over 50 million people worldwide, and 1 in 200 children worldwide.

### Classification

The ILAE classifies Epilepsy into four main types based on the seizure type (or types) \[3\]. These
are:

-   Focal epilepsy
-   Generalised epilepsy
-   Combined generalised and focal epilepsy
-   Epilepsy with unknown seizure type(s)

### Causes

All causes of epilepsy can be grouped into six main categories as follows:

a.  Structural: e.g., lissencephaly, tumours, calcifications, post-stroke, tuberous sclerosis
    complex, etc.
b.  Genetic: e.g., familial neonatal seizures, Dravet syndrome, etc.
c.  Infections: e.g., neurocysticercosis, HIV, post-meningitis, etc.
d.  Metabolic: e.g., hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, inborn errors of metabolism, vitamin
    deficiency, etc.
e.  Immune-mediated: autoimmune encephalitis
f.  Unknown
