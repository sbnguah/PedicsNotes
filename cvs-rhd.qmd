## Definition

Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) is an acquired heart disease and the only permanent sequel of
Rheumatic Fever (RF). Thus, it is acquired after an episode of RF. RHD should, therefore, be
distinguished from RF as they are two different but closely related disease entities.

## Incidence/prevalence

RHD is the most common acquired heart disease in children, with a prevalence

Rheumatic fever (RF) is a significant public health concern, especially in developing countries.
Here are some key points about its epidemiology:

### **Global Burden**

-   **Prevalence**: Approximately 33.4 million people worldwide are affected by rheumatic heart
    disease (RHD), a complication of rheumatic fever.
-   **Incidence**: Around 300,000 to 500,000 new cases of rheumatic fever are reported annually,
    with about 60% of these cases progressing to rheumatic heart disease.

### **Geographical Distribution**

-   **High Burden Regions**: The African, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific regions have the
    highest prevalence, accounting for 84% of all cases and 80% of deaths due to RHD.
-   **Specific Countries**: India has the highest global prevalence, followed by China and
    indigenous populations in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific island states.

### **Demographics**

-   **Age**: Rheumatic fever most commonly occurs in childhood.
-   **Gender**: Historically, females have been more affected than males, but recent reports suggest
    a more balanced gender distribution in some regions.

### **Risk Factors**

-   **Streptococcal Infections**: Rheumatic fever follows pharyngeal infection with Group A
    Streptococcus (GAS).
-   **Genetic Susceptibility**: Individuals with certain genetic backgrounds are more susceptible to
    developing rheumatic fever after a strep infection.

### **Prevention and Control**

-   **Early Detection and Treatment**: Prompt treatment of strep throat with antibiotics can prevent
    rheumatic fever.
-   **Long-term Antibiotic Prophylaxis**: Regular antibiotic treatment is recommended for
    individuals who have had rheumatic fever to prevent recurrence.

### **Challenges**

-   **Data Gaps**: Reliable data on the incidence of acute rheumatic fever is lacking in many
    regions, making it difficult to implement effective prevention measures.
-   **Healthcare Access**: Limited access to healthcare in low- and middle-income countries
    contributes to the high burden of the disease.

Rheumatic fever remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly among young people in
developing nations. Efforts to improve early detection, treatment, and long-term management are
crucial to reducing its impact.
