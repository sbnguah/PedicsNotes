## **Definition**

Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is a progressive, restrictive cardiomyopathy characterized by fibrotic
thickening of the endocardium, predominantly affecting the inflow tracts of the right and/or left
ventricles. This leads to impaired diastolic filling, atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and
ultimately heart failure. EMF is most commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions, and it
remains an important cause of pediatric heart failure in these areas.

## **Incidence/Prevalence**

-   EMF is primarily seen in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
    India, and parts of South America.
-   It is estimated to affect 10 million people worldwide, with the highest burden in children and
    young adults.
-   The prevalence in endemic areas ranges from 10% to 20% of all heart diseases.
-   The condition is more common in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and is associated
    with malnutrition and infections.
-   While rare in developed countries, cases have been reported in immigrants from endemic regions.

## **Aetiology**

The exact cause of endomyocardial fibrosis remains unknown, but several contributing factors have
been proposed, including:

1.  **Infectious Causes:**
    -   Parasitic infections such as *Plasmodium falciparum* (malaria) and *Schistosoma* species
        have been implicated in the pathogenesis.
    -   Viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus and Coxsackie virus, have also been
        suggested.
2.  **Autoimmune Mechanisms**
    -   Immune system dysregulation leading to chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
    -   Presence of eosinophilia in many patients suggests an allergic or immune-mediated response.
3.  **Nutritional Deficiencies:**
    -   Chronic malnutrition, specifically deficiencies in magnesium, selenium, and protein, may
        predispose individuals to EMF.
    -   Exposure to toxic dietary substances such as cassava, which contains cyanogenic glycosides,
        is considered a potential factor
4.  **Genetic Predisposition:**
    -   Familial clustering has been noted in some endemic areas, suggesting a genetic
        susceptibility to the disease.
5.  **Environmental Factors:**
    -   Living in rural, low-income areas with high exposure to infections and dietary toxins.

**Pathophysiology**

-   EMF predominantly affects the ventricular endocardium, leading to fibrosis that extends from the
    apex toward the atrioventricular valves.
-   **Right ventricular involvement** is more common than left, but both can be affected
    (biventricular disease).
-   Fibrosis results in:
    1.  **Diastolic dysfunction:** The stiff ventricle cannot fill adequately, leading to elevated
        atrial pressures.
    2.  **Atrioventricular valve regurgitation:** Fibrosis and restriction of valve movement lead to
        tricuspid or mitral regurgitation.
    3.  **Thrombus formation:** The fibrotic endocardium is prone to thrombus development, which can
        embolize systemically or to the lungs.
    4.  **Myocardial dysfunction:** Though the myocardium is often spared early in the disease,
        late-stage fibrosis can affect contractility and lead to heart failure.

**Signs and Symptoms**

The clinical presentation of EMF in children varies depending on the extent of cardiac involvement
and which ventricle is affected.

**Right Ventricular EMF (Most Common Presentation):**

-   Signs of right heart failure:
    -   Hepatomegaly

    -   Ascites

    -   Peripheral edema

    -   Elevated jugular venous pressure
-   Fatigue and exercise intolerance
-   Right upper quadrant pain due to liver congestion

**Left Ventricular EMF:**

-   Signs of left heart failure:
    -   Pulmonary congestion (dyspnea, orthopnea)
    -   Cough, hemoptysis (in advanced cases)
    -   Fatigue and poor growth in children
-   Systemic embolization (e.g., stroke) from left-sided thrombus formation

**Biventricular Disease:**

-   Severe heart failure with a combination of right- and left-sided symptoms
-   Anasarca (generalized edema)
-   Reduced cardiac output leading to shock in advanced case

**General Symptoms:**

-   Failure to thrive
-   Recurrent respiratory infections
-   Cyanosis (in severe cases)

**Investigations**

**1. Blood Tests:**

-   Eosinophilia: Found in a subset of patients.
-   Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR).
-   Liver function tests: Abnormal in cases with severe right heart failure.
-   Pro-BNP: Elevated in cases of heart failure.

**2. Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

-   Low voltage QRS complexes.
-   Right or left atrial enlargement.
-   Conduction abnormalities (e.g., atrioventricular block)

**3. Echocardiography (Key Diagnostic Tool):**

-   Thickened endocardium, especially in the apical region.
-   Atrioventricular valve regurgitation.
-   Restricted ventricular filling pattern.
-   Intracardiac thrombus formation.
-   Diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function in early stages.

**4. Cardiac MRI:**

-   Provides detailed imaging of fibrotic areas.
-   Helps differentiate EMF from other restrictive cardiomyopathies.

**5. Cardiac Catheterization:**

-   Confirms restrictive physiology with elevated end-diastolic pressure

**6. Endomyocardial Biopsy:**

-   Rarely performed but can confirm fibrosis histologically.

**Treatment**

Treatment of endomyocardial fibrosis in children is primarily supportive and aimed at symptom
relief.

**1. Medical Management:**

-   **Diuretics:** Reduce fluid overload and symptoms of heart failure.
-   **Anticoagulation:** Indicated for patients with atrial fibrillation or intracardiac thrombi.
-   **ACE inhibitors/ARBs:** Help reduce afterload and improve heart function.
-   **Nutritional support:** Address malnutrition with appropriate supplementation.

**2. Surgical Management:**

-   Endocardial resection and valve repair or replacement in selected cases.
-   High surgical risk with variable outcomes in children.

**3. Symptomatic Care:**

-   Management of complications such as arrhythmias and infections.
-   Regular follow-up for disease progression and heart failure management.

**Complications**

-   **Heart Failure:** Progressive and refractory to medical therapy.
-   **Thromboembolism:** Stroke, mesenteric ischemia, or pulmonary embolism.
-   **Arrhythmias:** Atrial fibrillation or heart block leading to sudden cardiac death.
-   **Growth retardation:** Due to chronic illness and malnutrition.
-   **Infective endocarditis:** Due to damaged endocardial surfaces.

**Prognosis**

-   EMF is a chronic, progressive condition with a poor long-term prognosis.
-   Early diagnosis and medical management can improve quality of life.
-   In children, the prognosis is worse if diagnosed late or if biventricular involvement is
    present.
-   Surgical intervention provides limited benefit and carries high perioperative risks.

**Differential Diagnosis**

-   **Restrictive Cardiomyopathy:** Similar presentation but without endocardial fibrosis on
    imaging.
-   **Constrictive Pericarditis:** Presents with similar right heart failure symptoms but is
    distinguished by pericardial thickening on imaging.
-   **Rheumatic Heart Disease:** Can cause valvular regurgitation and heart failure but lacks
    endocardial thickening.
-   **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome:** Can mimic EMF but includes systemic involvement (e.g., skin,
    lungs).
