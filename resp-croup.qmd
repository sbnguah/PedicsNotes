## Introduction

Croup, medically known as laryngotracheobronchitis, is a common acute upper respiratory illness in
children, characterized by inspiratory stridor, a barking cough, and hoarseness. It typically
results from a viral infection that causes inflammation of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Though
it is usually self-limiting, it can occasionally lead to life-threatening airway obstruction. Croup
is particularly important for medical students and healthcare providers in Ghana, where respiratory
infections are a leading cause of childhood morbidity, particularly during the rainy season when
viral infections peak.

## Epidemiology

-   **Age group**: Primarily affects children between **6 months and 5 years**. The peak incidence
    occurs around **2 years of age**.
-   **Gender**: Males are slightly more affected than females.
-   **Seasonality**: Most cases occur during the rainy or cold seasons (June to October in Ghana),
    coinciding with an increase in viral respiratory infections.
-   **Prevalence**: Although there is limited Ghana-specific data, studies across sub-Saharan Africa
    indicate that viral croup accounts for a significant proportion of paediatric respiratory
    admissions, particularly in urban areas such as Accra and Kumasi.

## Etiology

Viral infections most commonly cause croup. The **Parainfluenza virus type 1** is the most frequent
cause globally and in Ghana.

**Common viral agents:**

-   **Parainfluenza viruses** (types 1, 2, 3)
-   **Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)**
-   **Influenza A and B**
-   **Adenoviruses**
-   **Rhinoviruses**
-   **Coronavirus (including some SARS-CoV-2 variants)**

These viruses infect and inflame the epithelial lining of the **upper airway**, leading to swelling,
increased mucus, and narrowed air passages, especially in the subglottic region.

## Pathophysiology

The hallmark of croup is **subglottic inflammation**. In the paediatric airway, the narrowest part
is the **subglottic space**, located just below the vocal cords. Viral infection triggers:

-   Mucosal oedema
-   Cellular infiltration
-   Increased mucus production

These changes reduce airway diameter, particularly during **inspiration**, leading to:

-   **Stridor** (turbulent airflow)
-   **Barking cough** (from irritated vocal cords)
-   **Respiratory distress** in severe cases

Young children are especially vulnerable due to their **smaller airway diameter** and less developed
respiratory musculature.

## Clinical Features

The classic presentation involves:

**Prodromal Phase:**

-   Begins with **non-specific upper respiratory symptoms**:

    -   Nasal congestion
    -   Rhinorrhoea
    -   Low-grade fever
    -   Mild cough

**Croup Syndrome:**

-   **Barking cough** (seal-like)
-   **Hoarseness**
-   **Inspiratory stridor** (worse with agitation or crying)
-   **Respiratory distress** (tachypnoea, nasal flaring, retractions)
-   **Fever** (low to moderate)

Symptoms often **worsen at night**, leading to sudden parental concern.

**Severity Classification:**

1.  **Mild**:
    -   Occasional barking cough
    -   No stridor at rest
    -   No retractions
2.  **Moderate**:
    -   Frequent cough
    -   Stridor at rest
    -   Mild to moderate chest wall retractions
3.  **Severe**
    -   Marked stridor at rest
    -   Severe retractions
    -   Agitation or lethargy
    -   Hypoxia (SpO₂ \< 92%)
4.  **Impending respiratory failure**:
    -   Decreased level of consciousness
    -   Fatigue
    -   Cyanosis
    -   Silent chest

## Differential Diagnoses

Croup must be differentiated from other **causes of upper airway obstruction**:

|                             |                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Condition**               | **Key Differences**                                                    |
| **Epiglottitis**            | Sudden onset, high fever, toxic appearance, drooling, "tripod" posture |
| **Foreign body aspiration** | Sudden choking episode, unilateral breath sounds                       |
| **Bacterial tracheitis**    | High fever, purulent secretions, toxic look                            |
| **Peritonsillar abscess**   | Older children, muffled voice, difficulty opening mouth                |
| **Retropharyngeal abscess** | Neck stiffness, drooling, visible swelling on imaging                  |

## Diagnosis

Croup is primarily a **clinical diagnosis**, especially in resource-limited settings like many areas
in Ghana.

**Clinical Evaluation:**

-   Vital signs: look for tachypnoea, fever
-   Oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry)
-   General appearance: level of alertness, work of breathing

Investigations

-   **Neck X-ray (AP view)**: May reveal the classic “steeple sign” (subglottic narrowing), although
    it is not routinely needed.
-   **CBC, CRP**: Not usually necessary unless bacterial superinfection is suspected.
-   **Nasopharyngeal swabs**: Can confirm viral aetiology, but are rarely done due to cost and
    availability.

## Management

Management depends on **severity**. The key principles are:

-   Relieve airway obstruction
-   Reduce inflammation
-   Minimize agitation
-   Monitor for deterioration

### **General Measures:**

-   **Keep the child calm**: Crying worsens stridor.
-   **Humidified air**: Traditionally used, though evidence is weak.
-   **Supplemental oxygen**: For SpO₂ \< 92% or signs of hypoxia.

### **Pharmacologic Treatment**

**1. Corticosteroids**

Mainstay of treatment, regardless of severity.

-   **Dexamethasone** (preferred):
    -   Dose: 0.15–0.6 mg/kg PO/IM/IV (max 10 mg)
    -   Long half-life (\~36–72 hours), a single dose is often enough
-   **Prednisolone** (if dexamethasone unavailable):
    -   Dose: 1 mg/kg/day PO for 3–5 days

**Corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation, decrease hospital admissions, and shorten the duration
of illness.**

**2. Nebulized Epinephrine (Racemic or L-epinephrine)**

-    Used for moderate to severe croup:
-   Dose: 0.5 mL of 2.25% racemic epinephrine or 5 mL of 1:1000 L-epinephrine via nebulizer.
-   Acts quickly but temporarily (1–2 hours), often used while waiting for the corticosteroid
    effect.
-   Observe the child for 3–4 hours after administration for any rebound symptoms.

**3. Antibiotics**

Not indicated unless there is a suspicion of bacterial tracheitis or a secondary infection (high
fever, toxic appearance, purulent secretions).

**Monitoring and Admission Criteria**

**Admit if:**

-    Persistent stridor at rest following epinephrine
-   Hypoxia (SpO₂ \< 92% on room air)
-   Severe work of breathing
-   Inadequate oral intake
-   Age under 6 months
-   Pre-existing comorbidities (e.g., sickle cell disease, malnutrition)

In Ghana, **admission should also be considered if reliable follow-up is uncertain**, especially in
rural or underserved areas.

## **Complications**

-   Respiratory failure
-   Secondary bacterial tracheitis
-   Dehydration
-   Rarely, death (usually in severe, untreated cases)

## **Prevention**

-   **Routine immunization**: Influenza and measles vaccines reduce incidence
-   **Hand hygiene and cough etiquette**
-   **Avoid exposure to sick contacts**, especially during viral seasons

## **Public Health Considerations in Ghana**

-   **Limited access to nebulizers or corticosteroids** in rural facilities may delay treatment.
-   **Overcrowding and poor ventilation** increase the transmission of respiratory viruses.
-   **Training** **community health workers** in the recognition and referral of severecases is
    crucial.
-   Integration of **Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)** strategies can help guide
    early treatment at the primary care level.

## **Conclusion**

Croup is a common, self-limiting pediatric illness that can become life-threatening without prompt
recognition and management. Medical students and practitioners in Ghana should be proficient in
diagnosing croup based on clinical features and effectively managing it with corticosteroids and
supportive care. Knowing when to escalate care is crucial, particularly in resource-constrained
settings.
