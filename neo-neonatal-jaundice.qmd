## Introduction

Jaundice is the yellowish discoloration of the skin, eyes and mucous membranes, caused by a pigment
called bilirubin in the blood. Out of 10 term and 10 preterm infants, 6 and 8 of them will develop
jaundice respectively, all in the 1st couple of weeks of life. Universally accepted as one of the
commonest causes of admission and readmission in the first month of life. At KATH MBU, monthly
admissions average between 300 and 400 and about 15 -- 25% of all these admissions are cases of
neonatal jaundice. Whereas the developed world describes kernicterus as a rare condition,
unfortunately, the same cannot be said for us in developing countries. On average, cases of severe
NNJ have ranged from 2.2% -- 30.8% of all jaundice cases, with the monthly mortality from NNJ
ranging from 2.8% - 15.2%. Remember, kernicterus is the only preventable cause of cerebral palsy!

## Bilirubin metabolism

Humans continuously form bilirubin and the liver is the main organ responsible for the metabolism of
bilirubin. For every gram of Hemoglobin, 35mg of bilirubin is produced.\
The bilirubin is conjugated by the UGT enzyme, making it water-soluble, which is then released into
the bile before being excreted in the stool (and urine). It can also be broken down in the intestine
by bacterial enzymes like E. coli. However, at birth, the newborn has several challenges. The liver
is immature, and the levels of UGT are low. Newborns have β-glucuronidase in the intestinal
mucosa/brush border, which deconjugates the conjugated bilirubin found in the meconium. The
unconjugated bilirubin can now be reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and recycled back into the
circulation. This process is known as the "enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin". The gut is
sterile and, subsequently, infants have far fewer bacteria in the gut, and so very little, if any,
bilirubin is reduced to urobilin and stercobilin.

**Specifically to newborns**\
More bilirubin is produced, on account of the short life span of Red Blood Cells and high Hemoglobin
levels. The liver is immature. They also have fewer bacteria and low intestinal enzymatic activity
in the intestine

## Types of bilirubin

There are two types:

**Unconjugated (Indirect) Bilirubin**:\
This is lipid soluble, can cross the blood-brain barrier and is toxic in high amounts to the brain.

**Conjugated (Direct) Bilirubin**:\
This is water soluble, excreted in the urine and stool, and not toxic to the brain. However, high
amounts could indicate underlying liver disease or injury.\

In very high concentrations, unconjugated bilirubin, which is lipid soluble, is toxic to the
developing brain. Once it crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to brain tissue and deposits in
the developing brain. Since this is an irreversible process, it leads to long-term neurological
issues and even death.

## Types of Jaundice

There are two main types of jaundice:\

1.  Physiological jaundice and
2.  Pathological jaundice.

There are three main mechanisms for jaundice:\

1.  Increased bilirubin production
2.  Decreased bilirubin clearance and
3.  Increased enterohepatic circulation.

### Physiological jaundice

**Increased bilirubin production**:\
in term newborn infants, bilirubin production is 2 -- 3x higher than in adults. This occurs because
newborns have more RBCs and fetal RBCs have a shorter life span than those in adults. Unfortunately,
the liver being immature, cannot conjugate and excrete all the bilirubin from the breakdown of all
the excess RBCs, thereby resulting in spillover of bilirubin into the blood.\

**Bilirubin clearance or excretion**:\
This is decreased in newborns, mainly due to the low levels of the UGT enzyme in the liver. UGT
activity in term infants at day 7 of age is approximately 1% of that of the adult liver and does not
reach adult levels until about 14 weeks of age.\

**Enterohepatic circulation**:\
The presence of the ß-glucuronidase results in an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of
bilirubin, further increasing the bilirubin load in the infant. This is a diagnosis of exclusion

### Pathological jaundice

**Definition**\
Neonatal jaundice is said to be pathologic if:

-   Jaundice in the 1st 24 - 48 hours of life.
-   Rate of SB rise \> 0.5 mg/dL (8.5µmol/L) per hour
-   Jaundice all over the body (including palms & soles)
-   Presence of a danger sign
-   History of previous siblings having had jaundice at birth
-   Jaundice in a term newborn after 2 weeks of age or in a preterm infant after 3 weeks of age
-   Direct (conjugated) bilirubin concentration \> 20% of the total

It can be caused by certain pathologic conditions or exaggeration of the mechanisms responsible for
physiologic neonatal jaundice. Identification of what is causing the jaundice is useful in guiding
management, including counselling of the parents and what to expect for the next pregnancy. Most
common cause is increased bilirubin production due to haemolytic disease processes that include the
following:\

-   Isoimmune-mediated haemolysis (e.g., ABO or Rhesus D incompatibility)
-   Erythrocyte enzymatic defects, e.g. G6PD deficiency
-   Sepsis, especially Urinary Tract Infection
-   Polycythaemia
-   Birth Injuries resulting in sequestration of blood within a closed space, e.g. cephalohematoma,
    subgaleal bleed.

**ABO incompatibility**\
This is one of the most common causes of isoimmune hemolytic disease during the neonatal period.
Infants with blood group A or B, carried by blood group O mother, will have a positive antibody
because of maternal anti-A or anti-B transfer into the fetal circulation.\

**Rhesus Incompatibility**\
Rh incompatibility can occur when an Rh-negative pregnant mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal red
blood cells secondary to feto-maternal haemorrhage during pregnancy/delivery. As a result, the
mother's blood gets exposed to the fetal circulation and sensitization occurs leading to maternal
antibody production against the foreign Rh antigen. Once produced, maternal Rh (IgG) antibodies may
cross freely from the placenta to the fetal circulation, where they form antigen-antibody complexes
with Rh- positive fetal RBCs and eventually are destroyed, resulting in a fetal alloimmune-induced
hemolytic anaemia and jaundice. The first pregnancy is usually not affected, but more antibodies are
produced with each pregnancy making the jaundice worse with each pregnancy.

**Decreased clearance or a reduction in the rate of excretion of bilirubin**:\
Inherited defects in the gene that encodes the UGT liver enzyme (eg, Gilbert Syndrome), decrease
bilirubin conjugation (eg Crigglar Najjar). In physiological jaundice, the levels are naturally low,
but here, in addition to the low levels the UGT enzyme is either defective, absent or has a reduced
function. This reduces hepatic bilirubin metabolism and its clearance thereby increasing the total
serum unconjugated bilirubin levels.

**Increased enterohepatic circulation**\
The major causes are\

-   Breastfeeding jaundice
-   Breast milk jaundice
-   Impaired intestinal motility is caused by functional or anatomic obstruction.
-   Congenital hypothyroidism also causes increased enterohepatic circulation on account of reduced
    gut motility.

## Assessing for Neonatal Jaundice

-   Baby should be assessed in natural daylight
-   Look for yellow eyes & skin, check the white part of the eyes only if the baby opens the eyes
    voluntarily.
-   You may blanch the skin on the bridge of the nose or the palms/soles of the feet if they turn
    yellow...
-   Remember that the yellowing spreads from head to toe...
-   Do not rely on visual inspection alone to estimate the bilirubin level in a baby with
    jaundice!!! It can be very subjective!!

## Clinical features

The clinical features of neonatal jaundice may include:

-   Baby looks yellow! The yellowness appears cephalocaudal.
-   May not be as active as he/she used to be
-   Lethargic/hypotonic
-   Weak cry, irritable
-   Poor feeding
-   High-pitched cry / poor cry
-   Seizures
-   Arching of the neck/back

Thus to evaluate a child with jaundice we:

-   Determine birth weight, gestation and postnatal age (in hours)
-   Assess clinical condition (well or ill)
-   Degree of jaundice (visual inspection, SBR etc)
-   Look for evidence of kernicterus / BIND

## Management

The general principle of treatment includes

-   Encourage frequent exclusive breastfeeding.
-   Start Intravenous fluids only when there are signs of dehydration
-   Watch out for danger signs
-   Pathologic Neonatal jaundice is treated with
    -   Phototherapy
    -   Exchange Blood Transfusion (EBT)
    -   Antibiotics

Be interested in the cause as this will serve as a guide in the management of the baby and direct
your counselling as well as impact on subsequent pregnancies Loads of information in the maternal
and child health record book, Gravidity and Parity, G6PD status, maternal Blood group & Rhesus
status etc

### Investigations

This should include but not be restricted to

-   Serum Bilirubin (conjugated, unconjugated and total)
-   Full Blood Count
-   G6PD screening
-   Blood Culture & Sensitivity
-   Baby's blood group (only necessary if mother's blood group is O)
-   Others include Direct Coomb's test, Urine C & S etc

### Phototherapy

Phototherapy is the use of visible light to treat high levels of serum bilirubin in the newborn. The
dose of phototherapy is a key factor in how quickly it works. The dose in turn is determined by:

-   The wavelength of the light
-   The intensity of the light (irradiance)
-   The distance between the light and the baby
-   The body's surface area is exposed to the light.

Effective phototherapy lowers serum bilirubin levels by converting the lipid-soluble bilirubin into
water-soluble forms that can easily be excreted in the stool and urine Phototherapy also prevents
the need for an Exchange Blood Transfusion and prevents bilirubin from depositing in the brain. The
breakdown of bilirubin begins almost instantaneously when the skin is exposed to light, hence,
phototherapy should be started as early as possible.

**Initiating phototherapy** Always note the time the baby's SBR sample is being taken and estimate
the age in hours up until that time. Interpret bilirubin levels according to the baby's postnatal
age in hours and manage the bilirubin levels according to the threshold table Start phototherapy if
the SBR plots on or above the line appropriate for age (in hours) and gestational age If the SBR
plots just underneath the line, repeat the SBR after 6 hours or start phototherapy if a repeat is
not feasible. Repeat the SBR at least 24 -- 48 hours after initiation of phototherapy. Discontinue
phototherapy when the SBR plots below the line.

**Side effects**\

-   Increase insensible water loss
-   Loose stools
-   Skin rash
-   Bronze baby syndrome
-   Hypo- or Hyperthermia
-   Interruption of mother-baby bonding

##Sunlight Therapy Works for physiological jaundice, however, one can never tell by looking at a
baby what kind of jaundice a baby has Err on the side of caution, at least always have the SBR
checked first Remember prolonged exposure to UV rays can be harmful to the developing skin Baby
cannot be put in the light for more than 30 minutes in a day Even most of the available literature
and studies that recommend sunlight still advice that if the jaundice is severe, the baby must be
managed in the hospital!! A serum bilirubin high enough to warrant treatment should be managed in
the hospital.

##Exchange Blood Transfusion Provides a means of rapid reduction of circulating bilirubin in blood.
Involves manual removal of the baby's blood and simultaneously replacing it with compatible donor blood.

In addition to reducing bilirubin levels EBT removes partially hemolyzed RBCs, RBCs coated with
antibodies and circulating immunoglobulins.

**Complications of Exchange Blood Transfusion**\
- Cardiac & respiratory disorders - Shock due to bleeding or inadequate replacement of blood
infection - Catheter-related complications - Changes in the composition of the blood (high or low
potassium, low calcium, low glucose, changes of pH) - Thrombocytopenia\
- And the rare but serious complications of air embolism, portal hypertension, and necrotizing
enterocolitis.

**Intravenous Immunoglobins** Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been suggested as
an alternative therapy to Exchange Blood Transfusion for isoimmune hemolytic jaundice to reduce the
need for Exchange Blood Transfusion and duration of phototherapy and hospitalization in isoimmune
hemolytic disease of the newborn. It has been proposed that IVIG blocks the binding of the antibody
to the antigen. With this blockade, hemolysis no longer occurs.

## Long term complications

The effects of bilirubin toxicity include

-   Hearing loss
-   Cerebral palsy
-   Mental retardation
-   Dental complications
-   Delayed developmental milestones
-   Seizure and visual disorders

## Recommendations

-   Always err on the side of caution
-   An SBR is always more objective
-   Look out for danger signs
-   As much breastmilk as possible by any means necessary
-   Sunlight therapy is not recommended, if the baby is yellow enough for you to want to put him/her
    under the sun, then the baby needs to be brought to the hospital!
