## Introduction

Blood transfusion is a critical, lifesaving intervention in paediatric practice. In sub-Saharan
Africa, including Ghana, transfusion plays a vital role in the management of severe anaemia,
neonatal conditions, trauma, malignancies, and surgical emergencies. However, transfusion also
carries significant risks such as transfusion reactions, infections, circulatory overload, and
alloimmunization.

Paediatric transfusion differs from adult transfusion in several key ways: children's blood volumes
are smaller, immune systems are less mature, and many transfusion indications arise from conditions
unique to childhood (e.g., severe malaria anaemia, haemoglobinopathies). Therefore, understanding
transfusion principles tailored to paediatrics is essential for safe and effective care.

This chapter provides a comprehensive review of paediatric transfusion medicine—including
physiology, indications, product selection, dosing, safety, and Ghana-specific considerations. It is
intended for medical students, residents, and practising paediatricians preparing for ward work and
examinations.

## Physiology of Blood and Components in Children

Children have different blood volumes and haematological characteristics compared with adults.

### Blood Volume by Age

| Age Group            | Approximate Blood Volume |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Preterm neonate      | 90–100 mL/kg             |
| Term neonate         | 80–90 mL/kg              |
| Infant (1–12 months) | 75–80 mL/kg              |
| Child                | 70–75 mL/kg              |
| Adolescent           | 65–70 mL/kg              |

The smaller the blood volume, the greater the physiological impact of even minor blood loss. A loss
of 20 mL of blood is negligible in an adult but clinically relevant in a neonate.

### Developmental Haematology

-   **Neonatal haemoglobin** is predominantly fetal haemoglobin (HbF), with high oxygen affinity.
-   **Physiological anaemia** occurs at 6–12 weeks due to decline in erythropoietin.
-   **Iron stores** deplete early in life, making infants more vulnerable to iron deficiency.
-   **Immune system immaturity** increases susceptibility to transfusion-transmitted pathogens and
    alloimmunization.

## Indications for Paediatric Transfusion

Transfusion decisions must balance expected benefits against risks. Indications can be grouped into:

1.  **Red Cell Transfusion**
2.  **Platelet Transfusion**
3.  **Plasma (FFP) Transfusion**
4.  **Cryoprecipitate Transfusion**
5.  **Whole Blood (rare, selected contexts)**

### Indications for Red Cell Transfusion

#### Acute Severe Anaemia

Common causes in Ghana:

-   Severe malaria
-   Sickle cell disease crises
-   Acute haemolysis (G6PD deficiency)
-   Acute bleeding (trauma, obstetric haemorrhage in adolescents)
-   Severe sepsis

**Thresholds for transfusion (common paediatric practice):**

-   Hb \< 4 g/dL — transfuse immediately.
-   Hb 4–6 g/dL — transfuse if symptomatic (shock, respiratory distress, heart failure).
-   Hb 6–10 g/dL — consider only in special situations such as:
    -   ongoing blood loss\
    -   cardiopulmonary disease\
    -   severe infection with compromised oxygen delivery\
-   Hb \> 10 g/dL — rarely indicated.

#### Chronic Anaemia

Conditions:

-   Thalassemia major\
-   Sickle cell disease (selected indications; not routine)\
-   Bone marrow failure syndromes\
-   Chronic renal disease

Transfusions are individualized, often part of long-term management.

#### Perioperative Transfusion

Indications:

-   Anticipated significant blood loss
-   Preoperative correction of Hb \< 8 g/dL in major surgery
-   Intraoperative haemodynamic instability due to blood loss

#### Neonatal Transfusion Indications

-   Symptomatic anaemia\
-   Anaemia of prematurity with severe cardiorespiratory compromise\
-   Significant iatrogenic blood loss in NICUs\
-   Exchange transfusion for severe jaundice (RBC + plasma)

## Blood Components and Their Uses

Modern transfusion practice prefers **component therapy** rather than whole blood.

### Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs)

-   Indicated for anaemia with reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.
-   Haematocrit: 50–70%.

### Whole Blood

-   Used in Ghana in select situations such as severe acute haemorrhage in resource-constrained
    facilities.
-   Haematocrit \~40%.
-   Higher risk of volume overload.

### Platelets

Indicated for:

-   Active bleeding with thrombocytopenia
-   Prophylaxis in very low platelet counts (\<10 × 10⁹/L)
-   Platelet dysfunction (e.g., uremia)

### Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)

Indications: - Bleeding due to coagulation factor deficiency - DIC - Warfarin reversal in
adolescents

Not for:

-   Volume expansion
-   Simple anaemia

### Cryoprecipitate

Contains fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor VIII.

Indications: - Hypofibrinogenemia (\<1 g/L) - Disseminated intravascular coagulation - Certain
bleeding disorders

## Dosing of Blood Components in Children

Paediatric transfusion doses are weight-based.

#### Red Blood Cells

-   **Dose:** 10–15 mL/kg (PRBC)
-   **Expected Hb rise:** 1–2 g/dL per 10 mL/kg
-   Neonates: 10–15 mL/kg over 2–4 hours

#### Whole Blood

-   20 mL/kg (for acute blood loss)

#### Platelets

-   **Dose:** 10–15 mL/kg

or

-   1 unit per 10 kg body weight

Expected rise: 20–40 × 10⁹/L

#### FFP

-   10–15 mL/kg

#### Cryoprecipitate

-   1 unit per 5 kg body weight

or

-   5–10 mL/kg

## Special Considerations in Neonatal Transfusion

Neonates have unique physiology requiring careful approach.

### Key Principles

-   Use **CMV-reduced**, **irradiated**, and **fresh (\<5 days old)** blood where available.
-   Avoid potassium accumulation by not using blood stored too long.
-   Transfuse slowly: **5 mL/kg/hr** unless urgent.

### Exchange Transfusion

Indications:

-   Severe hyperbilirubinemia
-   Haemolytic disease of the newborn

Blood requirements: - Crossmatch with mother’s blood - O-negative, antigen-compatible PRBCs
reconstituted with plasma - Haematocrit 40–50%

## Transfusion Decision-Making: Thresholds and Clinical Judgment

In resource-limited settings like Ghana, clinical judgment is especially important.

### Clinical Factors Supporting Transfusion:

-   Tachycardia
-   Respiratory distress
-   Signs of cardiac failure
-   Lethargy or altered consciousness
-   Hypoxia (SpO2 \< 92%)
-   Shock

### Laboratory Red Flags:

-   Hb \< 4 g/dL (emergency)
-   Hb \< 6 g/dL with symptoms
-   Rising lactate
-   Severe thrombocytopenia (\<10 × 10⁹/L)

### When Not to Transfuse:

-   Mild asymptomatic anaemia
-   Anaemia that is nutritional and not severe
-   Iron deficiency responsive to oral supplementation
-   Fever alone without evidence of haemodynamic compromise

## Risks and Complications of Transfusion

Transfusion is not without danger. Vigilance is mandatory.

### Acute Transfusion Reactions

-   **Febrile non-haemolytic reaction**
-   **Allergic reactions** (urticaria to anaphylaxis)
-   **Acute haemolytic reaction** (ABO mismatch)
-   **Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)**
-   **Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)**

### Delayed Reactions

-   Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction
-   Transfusion-transmitted infections
-   Alloimmunization (especially in sickle cell patients)
-   Iron overload (chronic transfusers)

### Transfusion-Transmitted Infections (TTIs)

In Ghana, screening is mandatory for:

-   HIV
-   Hepatitis B
-   Hepatitis C
-   Syphilis

Malaria transmission risk exists despite screening.

### Iron Overload

Occurs in:

-   Thalassemia major
-   Chronic transfusion protocols\
    **Management:** Iron chelation with deferasirox or deferoxamine.

## Transfusion Safety and Protocols

Safe transfusion practice involves multiple layers of protection.

### Pre-Transfusion Steps

-   Confirm indication.
-   Check baseline vitals.
-   Obtain informed consent.
-   Crossmatch blood (patient name, age, hospital number).
-   Use appropriate component.

### Bedside Checks

Always perform the **three Rs**:

1.  **Right patient**\
2.  **Right blood**\
3.  **Right time**

Any mismatch can be fatal.

### 3. Monitoring During Transfusion

| Time            | Action                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Start           | Observe for first 15 minutes; vital signs every 15 min |
| Mid-transfusion | Vitals every 30 min                                    |
| End             | Vitals at completion                                   |
| Post            | Monitor for late reactions                             |

Observe for:

-   Fever\
-   Rigors\
-   Rash\
-   Difficulty breathing\
-   Hypotension\
-   Haemoglobinuria

### Management of Transfusion Reactions

-   Stop transfusion immediately.
-   Maintain IV line with saline.
-   Check vitals and notify senior/clincians.
-   Send blood bag and samples for investigation.
-   Treat according to reaction type (antihistamine, adrenaline, oxygen support etc.).

## Transfusion in Special Groups

### Children With Severe Malaria

Common in Ghana.

Key points:

-   Hb \< 6 g/dL with respiratory distress → urgent transfusion.
-   Monitor for fluid overload.
-   Treat malaria concurrently with artesunate.

### Sickle Cell Disease

-   Transfuse only for specific indications:
    -   Acute chest syndrome\
    -   Stroke\
    -   Severe anaemia\
    -   Preoperative optimization
-   Use **HbS-negative**, matched blood if available.\
-   Avoid unnecessary transfusions to prevent alloimmunization.

### Oncology Patients

-   Require recurrent transfusions (platelets + RBCs).
-   High alloimmunization risk.
-   Need irradiated components if receiving chemotherapy causing immunosuppression.

## Blood Banking and Transfusion Services in Ghana

The National Blood Service (NBS) Ghana coordinates:

-   Blood donor recruitment
-   Testing and processing
-   Distribution to health facilities

### Challenges:

-   Heavy reliance on **replacement donors** rather than voluntary donors
-   Regular shortages necessitating the use of whole blood
-   Limited availability of specialized products such as irradiated blood
-   Challenges in cold chain maintenance in rural hospitals
-   High prevalence of TTIs in general population increasing risk of transfusion-transmitted
    infections

### Strengths:

-   National standardized screening procedures
-   Expanded donor mobilization programmes
-   Increasing availability of PRBCs and FFP in tertiary centres

Improving Ghana’s transfusion services requires enhanced voluntary donation and strengthened
hospital transfusion committees.

## Clinical Approach: How to Manage a Child Requiring Transfusion

**Step 1: Confirm Indication**

Ask: “Will this transfusion save the child’s life or significantly improve outcome?”

**Step 2: Evaluate Urgency**

-   Emergency (Hb \< 4 g/dL or shock)\
-   Semi-urgent\
-   Elective

**Step 3: Choose the Right Product**

-   Anaemia → PRBC\
-   Bleeding due to coagulopathy → FFP\
-   Severe thrombocytopenia → Platelets\
-   Hypofibrinogenemia → Cryoprecipitate

**Step 4: Calculate Dose**

Weight-based dosing.

**Step 5: Bedside Safety Checks**

Identity, unit number, compatibility.

**Step 6: Monitor and Document**

Before, during, and after the transfusion.

**Step 7: Reassess**

A post-transfusion Hb should be checked only when clinically necessary.

## Key Points for Exams and Clinical Practice

-   PRBC dose: **10–15 mL/kg** raises Hb by 1–2 g/dL.\
-   Whole blood for **massive haemorrhage**: 20 mL/kg.\
-   Platelets indicated when **platelets \<10 × 10⁹/L** without bleeding.\
-   Never use FFP for **nutritional anaemia** or **volume expansion**.\
-   Neonates require **fresh**, **CMV-reduced**, **irradiated** blood.\
-   In Ghana, severe malaria is the leading cause of paediatric transfusion.\
-   Monitor closely for TACO and TRALI.\
-   Document all transfusion reactions and report to hospital transfusion committee.
