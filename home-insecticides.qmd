## Introduction

Insecticide poisoning remains a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality across many
low- and middle-income countries. In Ghana and much of sub-Saharan Africa, the high burden of
vector-borne diseases such as malaria, combined with widespread agricultural activity, has led to
heavy reliance on insecticides in both domestic and farming environments. While these chemicals are
essential for public health and crop protection, they pose substantial risks to children, who are
naturally curious, physiologically vulnerable, and often exposed in poorly regulated environments.

Children may encounter insecticides through ingestion, inhalation, dermal absorption, or accidental
spills in the household. Toddlers exploring their surroundings are particularly at risk, especially
in homes where insecticides are stored in accessible places or transferred into beverage bottles. In
agricultural regions, children may also be exposed indirectly through contaminated clothing or via
residues carried into the home.

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of insecticide poisoning in children, focusing on the
insecticide types commonly used in Ghana, their mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, and
evidence-based management strategies adapted to resource-limited settings. The article-style
narrative offers context relevant to paediatricians, residents, emergency clinicians, and general
practitioners working in Ghana and similar environments.

## Overview of Insecticide Use in Ghana and West Africa

Insecticides are deeply embedded in everyday life in Ghana. Urban households frequently use
pyrethroid-based sprays, mosquito coils, and treated nets for mosquito control. Rural communities
rely heavily on organophosphate pesticides (e.g., chlorpyrifos, diazinon) to protect crops such as
cocoa, vegetables, and grains. Despite government regulations, many potent agricultural insecticides
remain readily accessible in shops, markets, and roadside stalls.

Challenges contributing to paediatric exposure include:

-   **Improper storage**: Chemicals kept within children’s reach or stored in food containers.
-   **Limited public awareness**: Many caregivers underestimate the toxicity of insecticides.
-   **Poor ventilation**: Spraying insecticides in closed rooms where children remain present.
-   **Agricultural exposures**: Families living on or near farms may carry residues indoors.
-   **Weak regulatory enforcement**: Persistent availability of highly hazardous pesticides.

In Ghanaian tertiary hospitals, insecticides consistently appear among the leading agents implicated
in paediatric poisoning cases. Mortality remains highest with organophosphate poisoning,
particularly in late presenters and settings with limited intensive care facilities.

## Classification of Insecticides Relevant to Childhood Poisoning

A broad range of insecticides are implicated in paediatric exposures. The major classes encountered
in Ghana and West Africa include:

### Organophosphates (OPs)

Examples: Chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion.\
Commonly used in agriculture and occasionally for home pest control.

### Carbamates

Examples: Carbaryl, carbofuran.\
Similar mechanism to organophosphates but reversible enzyme inhibition.

### Pyrethroids

Examples: Permethrin, deltamethrin, cypermethrin.\
Common in household sprays, mosquito coils, and treated nets.

### Organochlorines

Examples: Lindane, endosulfan (now restricted but still encountered informally).\
Persistent pollutants with potent CNS effects.

### Miscellaneous household insecticides

Including repellents (DEET), ant poisons, and mixed formulations containing solvents or
hydrocarbons.

Each class produces toxicity through distinct mechanisms, leading to characteristic clinical
Syndromes.

## Mechanisms of Toxicity

### Organophosphates

OPs irreversibly inhibit **acetylcholinesterase (AChE)**, resulting in excessive acetylcholine at
synapses. Toxicity manifests through:

-   **Muscarinic effects**: Bronchorrhoea, salivation, diarrhoea, vomiting, urination, bronchospasm.
-   **Nicotinic effects**: Muscle fasciculations, weakness, tachycardia or bradycardia.
-   **CNS effects**: Seizures, confusion, coma, respiratory failure.

### Carbamates

Carbamates inhibit AChE **reversibly**, often resulting in shorter and less severe toxicity than
OPs. However, in children, presentations may still be severe.

### Pyrethroids

Pyrethroids prolong the opening of sodium channels, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability. Toxic
effects include:

-   Paraesthesias
-   Tremors
-   Irritability
-   Hypersalivation
-   Seizures (especially in infants)
-   Respiratory irritation from aerosol inhalation

### Organochlorines

These agents disrupt **GABA-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission**, leading to:

-   Tremors
-   Hyperreflexia
-   Seizures
-   Status epilepticus

Because organochlorines persist in the environment and accumulate in fat, toxicity may be prolonged.

## Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation depends on the agent, route of exposure, and child’s age. Common features
include:

### Ingestion

-   Vomiting
-   Drooling
-   Diarrhoea
-   Abdominal pain
-   Altered consciousness

### Inhalation

-   Coughing
-   Wheezing
-   Respiratory distress
-   Headache or dizziness

### Dermal exposure

-   Erythema
-   Tingling or burning sensation
-   Absorption leading to systemic symptoms (especially with organophosphates)

### Organophosphate and Carbamate Poisoning: Cholinergic Syndrome

The hallmark of OP and carbamate poisoning is the **cholinergic toxidrome**, summarised by:

**DUMBBELSS**

-   **D**iarrhoea\
-   **U**rination\
-   **M**iosis\
-   **B**ronchorrhoea\
-   **B**radycardia\
-   **E**mesis\
-   **L**acrimation\
-   **S**alivation\
-   **S**weating

Respiratory failure results from bronchorrhoea, bronchospasm, fatigue, and CNS depression.

### Pyrethroid Poisoning

Usually mild. Symptoms include:

-   Paresthesias
-   Headache
-   Nausea
-   Irritability
-   Seizures at high doses
-   Respiratory symptoms from aerosol inhalation

### Organochlorine Poisoning

Predominantly neurological:

-   Tremors
-   Agitation
-   Seizures (often recurrent)
-   Potential arrhythmias

## Evaluation and Investigations

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, especially in Ghana where laboratory confirmation may not be
available.

Key investigations include:

-   **Blood glucose** (hypoglycaemia is common)
-   **Electrolytes, urea, creatinine**
-   **Full blood count**
-   **Arterial or venous blood gas**
-   **Chest X-ray** if aspiration is suspected
-   **ECG** to detect arrhythmias
-   **Serum cholinesterase levels**, if available (confirmatory for OP poisoning)

Assess the airway, breathing, circulation, level of consciousness, and seizure activity on arrival.

## Management

Management of insecticide poisoning in children focuses on stabilisation, decontamination, antidote
administration (where applicable), and supportive care.

### Stabilisation

-   **Airway**: Suction secretions, position airway, intubate if GCS \< 8 or severe respiratory
    distress.
-   **Breathing**: Give high-flow oxygen; ventilatory support if necessary.
-   **Circulation**: IV access, fluids for hypotension.
-   **Disability**: Control seizures with benzodiazepines.
-   **Exposure**: Remove contaminated clothing and wash skin thoroughly.

### Decontamination

-   Remove and bag contaminated clothing.
-   Wash affected skin with soap and water.
-   Activated charcoal may be used if ingestion occurred within 1 hour and airway reflexes are
    intact.

### Antidotes for Organophosphate and Carbamate Poisoning

#### **Atropine**

Atropine is the cornerstone of treatment. The goal is to improve breathing and dry airway
secretions.

-   Initial dose: 0.02 mg/kg IV\
-   Double the dose every 3–5 minutes until **atropinisation** (drying of secretions, improved air
    entry).
-   Continue with an infusion to maintain effect.

#### **Pralidoxime (2-PAM)**

Used in organophosphate poisoning to reactivate AChE before “aging” occurs.

-   Dose: 20–50 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes\
-   Followed by continuous infusion if necessary\
-   Availability is inconsistent in Ghana; early use improves outcomes.

### Management of Pyrethroid Poisoning

-   Supportive care only
-   Treat seizures with benzodiazepines
-   Bronchodilators for wheezing
-   Decontamination for dermal exposure

### Management of Organochlorine Poisoning

-   Aggressive seizure control
-   Avoid phenytoin (may worsen dysrhythmias)
-   Support ventilation
-   Activated charcoal if early ingestion

## Complications

Complications vary by insecticide type.

### Organophosphate Poisoning

-   **Intermediate syndrome** (1–4 days post-exposure): proximal muscle weakness, respiratory
    failure
-   **Delayed neuropathy** (weeks later)
-   **Aspiration pneumonia**
-   **ARDS**
-   **Hypoxic brain injury**

### Pyrethroids

-   Persistent paresthesias
-   Rare seizures

### Organochlorines

-   Recurrent seizures
-   Cardiac arrhythmias
-   CNS depression

## Prevention Strategies in Ghana

Prevention is the most impactful intervention. Strategies include:

-   Educating caregivers about safe storage and handling\
-   Keeping chemicals in original containers\
-   Avoiding spraying insecticides in rooms where children are present\
-   Training farmers on proper use and protective equipment\
-   Strengthening regulatory enforcement of pesticide sales\
-   Establishing poison control centres\
-   Counselling adolescents on mental health and suicide prevention

## Conclusion

Insecticide poisoning in children is both a medical emergency and a preventable public health issue
in Ghana. The severity of toxicity varies widely across insecticide classes, with organophosphates
remaining the most lethal. Early recognition, prompt resuscitation, and appropriate use of antidotes
are key to improving outcomes. Paediatric clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion,
especially in agricultural regions. Ultimately, sustainable reduction in cases depends on improved
public education, stronger regulation, and community-level safety practices.
