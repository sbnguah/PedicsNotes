## Introduction

Growth is one of the most visible and sensitive indicators of a child’s health and overall
well-being. In paediatrics, monitoring growth is an essential part of clinical care, as deviations
from normal patterns often signal underlying disease, malnutrition, or hormonal imbalance.

A **growth disorder** refers to any condition that results in abnormal stature or growth velocity
compared with reference standards for age and sex. These disorders may present as **short stature**,
**tall stature**, or **abnormal growth velocity**, and they can have **endocrine**, **genetic**,
**systemic**, or **nutritional** causes.

In Ghana and much of sub-Saharan Africa, poor nutrition, chronic infections, and delayed recognition
of endocrine disorders remain major contributors to abnormal growth. The limited availability of
specialized diagnostic tests often necessitates a pragmatic, clinically guided approach.

## Normal Growth Physiology

Normal growth is influenced by the complex interplay between genetic, nutritional, hormonal, and
environmental factors. The main hormones involved are:

1.  **Growth Hormone (GH):** Secreted by the anterior pituitary in a pulsatile manner, stimulating
    hepatic production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).
2.  **IGF-1 and IGFBP-3:** Mediate the growth-promoting effects of GH at the tissue level.
3.  **Thyroid hormones:** Essential for normal bone maturation and growth velocity.
4.  **Sex steroids (estrogen and testosterone):** Promote pubertal growth spurt and epiphyseal
    closure.
5.  **Cortisol:** In excess, inhibits growth.
6.  **Insulin:** Promotes growth through anabolic effects.

#### Phases of Growth

1.  **Infancy (0–2 years):** Rapid growth, largely nutrition-dependent.
2.  **Childhood (2 years–puberty):** Steady growth, GH-dependent.
3.  **Pubertal phase:** Growth acceleration due to synergistic effects of GH and sex steroids.

## Assessment of Growth

A systematic approach to growth assessment is essential for early recognition of abnormalities.

### Measurement Techniques

-   **Height:** Using a stadiometer (standing) or length board (infants).

-   **Weight:** Calibrated scale.

-   **Head circumference:** For children \<5 years.

-   **Mid-parental height (MPH):** Estimate of genetic potential.

    \[ \text{MPH (boys)} = \frac{(\text{father's height} + \text{mother's height} + 13)}{2} \] \[
    \text{MPH (girls)} = \frac{(\text{father's height} + \text{mother's height} - 13)}{2} \]

### Growth Charts

-   Use WHO or CDC growth charts.
-   Plot serial measurements to determine **growth velocity**.
-   Identify **crossing of centiles**, which is more significant than a single low value.

### Bone Age Assessment

-   X-ray of the left hand and wrist compared to Greulich and Pyle standards.
-   Bone age lags behind chronological age in endocrine causes, but is usually normal in familial
    short stature.

### Pubertal Assessment

-   Tanner staging for breast, genital, and pubic hair development.
-   Pubertal timing provides clues to underlying endocrine abnormalities.

## Classification of Growth Disorders

Growth disorders can be broadly classified as:

1.  **Short stature:** Height below the 3rd percentile or \>2 standard deviations (SD) below mean
    for age and sex.\
2.  **Tall stature:** Height above the 97th percentile or \>2 SD above mean.\
3.  **Abnormal growth velocity:** Deviation from expected rate for age.

This chapter focuses on **short stature**, the commonest concern in paediatric endocrinology.

## Short Stature

### Aetiological Classification

| Category | Example Disorders | Key Features |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Normal variants** | Familial short stature, constitutional growth delay | Normal bone age or delayed bone age with normal growth velocity |
| **Endocrine causes** | Growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome | Decreased growth velocity, delayed bone age |
| **Chronic systemic disease** | Renal, cardiac, hepatic disease, malnutrition | Poor weight gain precedes height faltering |
| **Genetic and skeletal disorders** | Turner syndrome, achondroplasia | Dysmorphic features, disproportionate body segments |
| **Psychosocial deprivation** | Neglect, chronic stress | Variable catch-up growth when environment improves |

## Endocrine Causes of Short Stature

### Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)

#### Definition

Deficiency of GH secretion, either isolated or as part of multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies.

#### Causes

-   **Congenital:** Pituitary hypoplasia, midline defects, genetic mutations.
-   **Acquired:** Brain tumours (craniopharyngioma), head trauma, CNS infections (meningitis,
    tuberculosis), irradiation.

#### Clinical Features

-   Normal birth size.
-   Progressive deviation from growth curve after 6 months.
-   Chubby face, truncal adiposity.
-   Delayed dentition, bone age, and puberty.
-   Often normal intelligence.

#### Investigations

-   **Serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3:** Screening tests (low in GHD).
-   **GH stimulation tests:** Using insulin, clonidine, or glucagon (confirmatory).
-   **MRI brain:** Evaluate pituitary and hypothalamus.
-   **Other pituitary hormones:** TSH, ACTH, gonadotropins.

#### Management

-   **Recombinant GH therapy** (0.03–0.05 mg/kg/day SC).
-   Monitor growth velocity and bone age.
-   Address underlying cause if secondary.

#### Ghanaian Context

GH assays and stimulation tests are limited to a few tertiary centres (e.g., KATH, KBTH). Empirical
diagnosis is sometimes supported by clinical features and low IGF-1, if available.

### Hypothyroidism

#### Pathophysiology

Deficiency of thyroid hormones impairs bone maturation, metabolism, and growth.

#### Clinical Features

-   Growth failure with delayed bone age.
-   Puffy face, coarse hair, dry skin.
-   Bradycardia, constipation, lethargy.
-   Delayed puberty.

#### Diagnosis

-   Low free T4, high TSH (primary hypothyroidism).
-   Low T4, low TSH (secondary hypothyroidism).

#### Management

-   Lifelong **levothyroxine replacement** (10–15 µg/kg/day).
-   Monitor TSH and growth response.

#### Local Note

In Ghana, neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism is not yet universal, so cases may
present late with severe growth retardation and cognitive impairment.

### Cushing’s Syndrome

#### Definition

Chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids (endogenous or exogenous).

#### Clinical Features

-   Growth failure with weight gain (hallmark).
-   Moon face, truncal obesity, striae, hypertension.
-   Proximal muscle weakness.

#### Causes

-   Prolonged steroid therapy (commonest in Ghana).
-   Adrenal or pituitary tumours (rare).

#### Management

-   Taper and discontinue exogenous steroids where possible.
-   Treat underlying pathology surgically or medically.

## Non-Endocrine Causes

### Chronic Systemic Illness

Chronic diseases such as renal failure, cyanotic congenital heart disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, and sickle cell anaemia impair growth.

#### Mechanisms

-   Nutritional deficits.
-   Increased energy demands.
-   Cytokine-mediated suppression of GH/IGF axis.

#### Management

-   Optimize control of the primary disease.
-   Nutritional rehabilitation.

### Malnutrition

A leading cause of growth retardation in Ghana.\
- **Kwashiorkor and marasmus** lead to stunting and wasting.\
- Linear growth improves only after prolonged nutritional rehabilitation.\
- Differentiation from endocrine short stature: **low weight-for-height** and **normal bone age**.

## Genetic and Skeletal Dysplasias

#### Turner Syndrome (45,X)

-   Short stature, webbed neck, shield chest.
-   Gonadal dysgenesis (streak ovaries).
-   Coarctation of aorta, renal anomalies.

**Diagnosis:** Karyotype confirmation.\
**Management:** GH therapy, estrogen replacement, cardiac and renal monitoring.

#### Achondroplasia

-   Disproportionate short stature.
-   Short limbs, large head, normal intelligence.
-   Autosomal dominant FGFR3 mutation.

## Tall Stature

Although less common, tall stature may also warrant evaluation.

### Causes

1.  **Familial tall stature:** Normal growth velocity, normal bone age.
2.  **Endocrine:** GH excess (gigantism), precocious puberty, hyperthyroidism.
3.  **Genetic:** Marfan syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome.
4.  **Obesity:** Early growth acceleration with premature epiphyseal closure.

#### Investigations

-   Bone age.
-   GH and IGF-1 levels.
-   Karyotype (for Klinefelter’s).
-   Echocardiography (for Marfan’s).

#### Management

-   Treat underlying endocrine cause.
-   Psychosocial support for body image issues.

## Growth Hormone Therapy: Principles and Monitoring

#### Indications

-   GH deficiency.
-   Turner syndrome.
-   Chronic renal failure.
-   Small for gestational age without catch-up by age 2 years.
-   Idiopathic short stature (in selected cases).

#### Administration

-   Daily subcutaneous injection at night.
-   Dose: 0.03–0.05 mg/kg/day.

#### Monitoring

-   Growth velocity (every 6 months).
-   Bone age (yearly).
-   IGF-1 levels (to guide dosing).
-   Adverse effects: pseudotumor cerebri, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, glucose intolerance.

#### Cost and Accessibility in Ghana

GH therapy is expensive (≈GHS 1500–2500/month) and rarely covered by national health insurance,
limiting access to selected tertiary hospitals. Efforts are ongoing to improve subsidization for
paediatric endocrine conditions.

## Approach to a Child with Short Stature

1.  **Confirm true short stature** (plot on chart).
2.  **Assess growth velocity** (serial measurements).
3.  **Evaluate mid-parental height**.
4.  **Assess for dysmorphism or disproportion**.
5.  **Investigate** based on findings:

| Step      | Key Tests                        | Purpose                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Screening | CBC, ESR, renal & liver function | Rule out systemic disease        |
| Endocrine | TSH, free T4, IGF-1              | Identify hypothyroidism or GHD   |
| Bone Age  | X-ray left hand                  | Assess growth potential          |
| Genetic   | Karyotype (girls)                | Detect Turner syndrome           |
| Imaging   | MRI brain                        | Assess pituitary or hypothalamus |

## Psychosocial and Public Health Aspects

-   **Psychological impact:** Children with growth disorders often face teasing, low self-esteem,
    and academic difficulties.
-   **Parental counselling:** Important to distinguish between benign and pathological causes.
-   **Community education:** Emphasize routine growth monitoring at child welfare clinics.
-   **Policy direction:** Advocacy for national newborn screening and early endocrine referral
    networks.

## Key Takeaways

-   Growth disorders are common indicators of underlying systemic or endocrine disease.\
-   Accurate measurement and serial growth plotting are crucial diagnostic steps.\
-   Endocrine causes typically have delayed bone age with preserved weight.\
-   In Ghana, nutritional and chronic disease-related growth failure remain prevalent, but endocrine
    causes should be considered early.\
-   Early referral to specialized centres can improve long-term outcomes.
