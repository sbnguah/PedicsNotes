## Introduction

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common renal disorder in childhood characterised by **massive
proteinuria**, **hypoalbuminemia**, **generalised oedema**, and **hyperlipidemia**. It results from
increased permeability of the glomerular basement membrane, allowing abnormal leakage of plasma
proteins into urine.

It is a major cause of morbidity among Ghanaian children, particularly between the ages of **2 and 8
years**, and is a frequent reason for referral to paediatric renal clinics. Early recognition and
appropriate management are critical to prevent complications such as infection, thrombosis, and
renal failure.

## Incidence and Epidemiology

Nephrotic syndrome is one of the most common glomerular diseases in children worldwide, but its
pattern varies by geography and race.

-   **Age:** Most cases occur between **2 and 8 years**, with a peak around **4 years**.
-   **Sex:** There is a male predominance (M:F ≈ 2:1).
-   **Geographical variation:**
    -   In **Europe and North America**, **minimal change disease (MCD)** accounts for 70–90% of
        idiopathic cases.
    -   In **West Africa**, including Ghana, **focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)** is more
        common, and steroid resistance rates are higher.
-   **Secondary nephrotic syndrome** may be seen with infections such as *hepatitis B*, *malaria*,
    *HIV*, or *systemic diseases such as lupus nephritis*.

## Aetiology and Classification

Nephrotic syndrome can be classified into **primary (idiopathic)** and **secondary** forms.

### Primary (Idiopathic) Nephrotic Syndrome

No identifiable systemic cause. Includes:

-   **Minimal Change Disease (MCD)** – the most common cause in younger children; characterised by
    normal light microscopy but podocyte effacement on electron microscopy.
-   **Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)** – affects older children; may follow MCD or occur
    de novo; associated with steroid resistance.
-   **Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN)** – uncommon but causes persistent proteinuria
    and reduced complement levels.

### Secondary Nephrotic Syndrome

Occurs due to identifiable systemic or renal disorders:

-   **Infections:** Hepatitis B, HIV, malaria, syphilis, tuberculosis.
-   **Systemic diseases:** Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
-   **Drugs:** NSAIDs, gold salts, penicillamine.
-   **Metabolic and inherited conditions:** Diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, Alport syndrome.

# Pathophysiology

The glomerular filtration barrier, comprising the endothelium, basement membrane, and podocyte
layer, normally prevents large proteins, such as albumin, from passing into the urine.

In nephrotic syndrome:

-   **Podocyte injury** or **loss of charge selectivity** leads to massive proteinuria (\>40
    mg/m²/hr or \>3.5 g/day).
-   **Loss of plasma proteins**, especially albumin, reduces plasma oncotic pressure, resulting in
    fluid movement into interstitial spaces → **oedema**.
-   **Hypovolemia** triggers activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and antidiuretic
    hormone, worsening sodium and water retention.
-   The liver's compensatory response increases lipoprotein synthesis → **hyperlipidemia** and
    **lipiduria**.

Thus, the four hallmark features are:

1.  Proteinuria
2.  Hypoalbuminemia
3.  Oedema
4.  Hyperlipidemia

## Clinical Features

### General Presentation

Onset is usually insidious over days to weeks.

**Main features:**

-   **Oedema:** Initially periorbital (especially in the morning), then generalized (anasarca).
-   **Ascites and pleural effusion:** From fluid transudation.
-   **Weight gain:** Due to fluid retention.
-   **Reduced urine output (oliguria):** Often dark and frothy.
-   **Fatigue and anorexia.**

### Examination Findings

-   Puffy face, periorbital and pedal oedema
-   Distended abdomen with ascites
-   Pleural effusion causing respiratory distress.
-   In advanced cases, scrotal or labial swelling
-   Pulse may be small due to hypovolemia.
-   Blood pressure is usually normal or slightly raised (if renal impairment develops)

## Differential Diagnosis

Other causes of oedema in children must be considered:

| **Condition**                     | **Distinguishing Features**                                    |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Acute glomerulonephritis          | Haematuria, hypertension, mild proteinuria, elevated ASO titre |
| Congestive heart failure          | Cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, pulmonary congestion               |
| Liver disease                     | Jaundice, hepatomegaly, abnormal LFTs                          |
| Protein-losing enteropathy        | Diarrhoea, malabsorption features                              |
| Severe malnutrition (Kwashiorkor) | Wasting, dermatosis, low total protein and albumin             |

## Investigations

### Urine Studies

-   **Dipstick:** Heavy proteinuria (≥3+).
-   **24-hour urinary protein:** \>40 mg/m²/hr or spot protein/creatinine ratio \>200 mg/mmol.
-   **Microscopy:** Few red cells and casts (in MCD, urine is bland).
-   **Lipiduria:** Fat droplets or “Maltese crosses” under polarised light.

### Blood Tests

-   **Serum albumin:** \<25 g/L.
-   **Serum cholesterol:** Often \>6.5 mmol/L.
-   **Electrolytes, urea, creatinine:** Assess renal function.
-   **Complement levels (C3, C4):** Reduced in lupus and MPGN.
-   **ASO titre, Hepatitis B, HIV screening** as indicated.

### Imaging

-   **Renal ultrasound:** Usually normal in MCD; may show increased echogenicity in chronic or
    secondary disease.
-   **Chest X-ray:** May reveal pleural effusion.

### Kidney Biopsy

Indicated when:

-   Age \<1 year or \>10 years
-   Gross haematuria
-   Persistent hypertension or renal failure
-   Low complement levels
-   Steroid resistance or frequent relapses

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome is made clinically and supported by laboratory findings:

**Diagnostic criteria:**

1.  Proteinuria \>3+ on dipstick
2.  Serum albumin \<25 g/L
3.  Oedema
4.  Hyperlipidemia

The child is classified based on steroid responsiveness as:

-   **Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS)**
-   **Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS)**
-   **Frequent relapser** or **steroid-dependent**

## Management

The approach to treatment depends on the underlying cause and the child’s response to steroids.

### Emergency and Supportive Care

**Hospital admission** is warranted for the first presentation or severe relapse with anasarca.

**Fluid and salt management**

-   Restrict sodium intake.
-   Maintain appropriate fluid balance, usually restricted to insensible loss plus urine output.
-   Daily weight and urine monitoring.

**Management of hypovolemia**

-   Suspect if tachycardia, abdominal pain, or cold extremities occur.
-   Give **10–20 mL/kg of 4.5% albumin** or normal saline cautiously, followed by furosemide.

**Infection prevention**

-   High risk for peritonitis (commonly *Streptococcus pneumoniae*), cellulitis, and sepsis.
-   Start **broad-spectrum antibiotics** if infection suspected.
-   Pneumococcal and varicella vaccination recommended.

**Nutritional support**

-   Adequate calories and protein (1–2 g/kg/day).
-   Avoid high-fat diets to prevent exacerbation of hyperlipidemia.

### Specific Treatment

#### Corticosteroid Therapy

Prednisolone remains the cornerstone of therapy for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.

**Initial episode (ISPN guidelines):**

-   **Prednisolone 60 mg/m²/day** (max 60 mg) for **4 weeks**, followed by
-   **40 mg/m² on alternate days** for another **4 weeks**, then taper gradually.

**Response monitoring:**

-   Daily urine dipstick for protein.
-   **Complete remission:** 3 consecutive days of negative or trace proteinuria.

#### Relapse

Reappearance of proteinuria (≥3+) for ≥3 days after remission. Treat with **prednisolone 60
mg/m²/day** until remission, then taper.

#### Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS)

No remission after 4 weeks of adequate steroid therapy. - Evaluate for **secondary causes** or
**FSGS** (via biopsy).

-   Consider **calcineurin inhibitors** (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), **mycophenolate mofetil**, or
    **cyclophosphamide**.
-   Manage under paediatric nephrology care.

### Management of Complications

| **Complication**                 | **Management**                                        |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Infection**                    | Prompt antibiotic therapy; pneumococcal prophylaxis   |
| **Hypovolemia**                  | Albumin infusion + diuretics                          |
| **Thrombosis (DVT, renal vein)** | Anticoagulation (heparin → warfarin)                  |
| **Acute renal failure**          | Supportive care, treat underlying cause               |
| **Dyslipidemia**                 | Dietary modification; statins if persistent           |
| **Hypertension**                 | ACE inhibitors (enalapril) beneficial for proteinuria |

### Preparation for Discharge

Before discharge: - Ensure oedema resolution and stable renal function.

-   Teach caregivers how to **check urine protein at home**.
-   Educate on **signs of relapse** and infection prevention.
-   Arrange follow-up schedule (weekly initially, then monthly).
-   Encourage vaccination where indicated.

### Long-Term Management and Follow-Up

-   **Monitor relapses:** Up to 70% of idiopathic cases relapse within 6 months.
-   **Minimise steroid toxicity**: Screen for growth retardation, obesity, cataracts, and
    hypertension.
-   **Address psychosocial impact:** School attendance and family anxiety.
-   **Nephrology referral:** For steroid dependence or resistance.

## Complications

**Acute**

-   Infection (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, cellulitis)
-   Hypovolemia and shock
-   Thrombosis (renal vein, cerebral venous sinus)
-   Acute renal failure

**Chronic**

-   Persistent proteinuria leading to chronic kidney disease
-   Growth retardation and delayed puberty
-   Steroid toxicity (hypertension, osteoporosis, Cushingoid features)

## Prevention

While idiopathic cases cannot be prevented, complications can be minimized by: - Early diagnosis and
appropriate steroid therapy

-   Routine immunization, especially **pneumococcal and varicella vaccines**
-   Avoiding nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., NSAIDs)
-   Educating families on prompt infection treatment
-   Regular follow-up at renal clinics

## Prognosis

-   **Minimal Change Disease:** Excellent prognosis; over 90% achieve remission with steroids.
-   **FSGS or secondary causes:** Higher risk of chronic renal failure.
-   **Steroid-dependent or frequent relapsers:** Often require second-line therapy but may maintain
    long-term renal function.

Relapses often decrease with age, and most children achieve permanent remission by adolescence.

## Conclusion

Nephrotic syndrome remains a significant paediatric renal disorder in Ghana, accounting for
substantial hospital admissions and morbidity. The majority of cases respond well to
corticosteroids, though steroid-resistant forms, particularly FSGS, are increasingly recognized. A
sound understanding of its clinical features, complications, and management principles is essential
for medical students and practitioners.\
Timely diagnosis, infection control, family education, and close follow-up remain the pillars of
good outcomes in paediatric nephrotic syndrome.
