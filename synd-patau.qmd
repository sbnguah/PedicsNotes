## Definition

Patau syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with the patient having an extra copy of chromosome 13
(Trisomy 13).

## Genetics

Patau Syndrome is due most commonly to non-disjunction in meiosis, occurring more frequently in
mothers of advanced age (greater than 35). Also, an unbalanced Robertsian translocation which
results in 2 normal copies of chromosome 13 and an additional long arm of chromosome 13 can cause
Edward's syndrome. A less common cause is mosaicism which results in 3 copies of chromosome 13 in
some cells and two copies in the others. Mosaics are the outcome of a mitotic non-disjunction error
and are unrelated to maternal age. The prognosis is better in patients with mosaicism and patients
with unbalanced translocations.

## Clinical features

This extra copy of chromosome 13 disrupts normal embryonic development and leads to multiple
defects. Some of these are:

-   *CNS*: Alobar holoprosencephaly, Anophthalmia, Microphthalmia, Coloboma, Intellectual
    disability, Hypotonia, Microcephaly, Seizures
-   *Gastrointestinal*: Exomphalos, Hernia, Meckel diverticulum, Omphalocele
-   *Genitourinary*: Polycystic kidneys, Cryptorchidism, Hypospadias, Labia Minora Hypoplasia
-   *Cardiovascular*: [Ventricular Septal Defect](cvs-vsd.qmd), [Atrial Septal Defect](cvs-asd.qmd),
    Atrioventricualr Canal Defect, [Tetralogy of Fallot](cvs-tof.qmd)
-   *Skeletal*: Polydactyly, Congenital talipes
-   *Craniofacial*: Cleft lip /cleft palate, Micrognathia
-   *Others*: Intrauterine Growth Restriction, Rocker bottom feet, Psychomotor disorders, Capillary
    hemangioma, Pre-auricular tags

## Investigation

-   Prenatally with chorionic villi sampling, amniocentesis or fetal free DNA analysis.
-   Tissue microarray (especially in fetal death)
-   FISH(fluorescent in-situ hybridization)

## Treatment

There is no definitive treatment for Patau syndrome. A multidisciplinary approach is required. Some
of these include:

-   Counselling
-   Rehabilitation team/ palliative team\
-   Occupational therapy
-   Psychology
-   Cardiology

## Counselling

There should be genetic counselling offered to the parents. Genetic testing for parents The
recurrence risk for Trisomy is approximately 0.5% above the motherâ€™s age-related risk for autosomal
trisomy. Consult a genetic counsellor or medical geneticist regarding recurrence risks for
structural rearrangements that involve chromosome 13. Prognosis is generally poor (82% die within 1
month, 95% die within 6 months)
