## Introduction

The adrenal glands are essential endocrine organs responsible for the production of glucocorticoids,
mineralocorticoids, and androgens. They play a central role in maintaining metabolism, electrolyte
balance, and the stress response.\
In children, adrenal gland disorders are particularly important because they can interfere with
growth, puberty, and survival during physiological stress.

This lecture provides an overview of the anatomy and physiology of the adrenal glands, followed by a
discussion of common paediatric adrenal disorders including **adrenal insufficiency**, **congenital
adrenal hyperplasia**, **Cushing syndrome**, **adrenal tumours**, and **disorders of adrenal
medulla**.

## Anatomy and Physiology

Each adrenal gland is composed of two distinct regions:

1.  **Adrenal cortex** — makes up about 90% of the gland.\
    It has three zones:
    -   **Zona glomerulosa** → secretes **aldosterone** (mineralocorticoid)\
    -   **Zona fasciculata** → secretes **cortisol** (glucocorticoid)\
    -   **Zona reticularis** → secretes **androgens** (DHEA and androstenedione)
2.  **Adrenal medulla** — produces catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) under sympathetic
    nervous control.

**Regulation:**

-   **ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)** from the anterior pituitary regulates cortisol and
    androgen synthesis.

-   **Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)** primarily controls aldosterone secretion.

## Major Adrenal Hormones and Their Actions

| Hormone          | Site of secretion | Major effects                                              |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cortisol         | Zona fasciculata  | Gluconeogenesis, anti-inflammatory effect, stress response |
| Aldosterone      | Zona glomerulosa  | Sodium retention, potassium excretion, water balance       |
| Androgens (DHEA) | Zona reticularis  | Pubic/axillary hair development                            |
| Catecholamines   | Medulla           | “Fight or flight” response                                 |

## Classification of Adrenal Disorders in Children

Adrenal disorders can be broadly classified into:

| Category | Examples |
|----|----|
| **Hypofunction (Adrenal insufficiency)** | Primary (Addison’s disease), Secondary (ACTH deficiency), Congenital adrenal hyperplasia |
| **Hyperfunction** | Cushing syndrome, Hyperaldosteronism, Adrenogenital syndromes |
| **Adrenal masses/tumours** | Neuroblastoma, Adrenocortical carcinoma, Adenoma |
| **Disorders of medulla** | Pheochromocytoma |

## Adrenal Insufficiency

### Definition

A condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient quantities of corticosteroids
(cortisol ± aldosterone).

### Classification

1.  **Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease):**
    -   Destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal cortex.
    -   Cortisol and aldosterone deficiency.
2.  **Secondary adrenal insufficiency:**
    -   Due to decreased ACTH secretion from the pituitary.
    -   Cortisol deficiency only.
3.  **Tertiary adrenal insufficiency:**
    -   Resulting from hypothalamic dysfunction or prolonged exogenous steroid therapy.

### Aetiology in Children

-   **Autoimmune adrenalitis** (most common in developed settings).\
-   **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)**.\
-   **Adrenal haemorrhage or infarction** (e.g., Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome).\
-   **Infections:** Tuberculosis, CMV, fungal infections.\
-   **Infiltrative diseases:** Adrenoleukodystrophy, metastatic neuroblastoma.\
-   **Surgical or drug-induced** (ketoconazole, etomidate).

### Clinical Features

-   Failure to thrive and weight loss\
-   Fatigue, weakness, lethargy\
-   Hyperpigmentation (in primary cases)\
-   Hypotension, dehydration, salt craving\
-   Hypoglycaemia and hyponatremia\
-   Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain

**In neonates:** prolonged jaundice, shock, or ambiguous genitalia (in CAH).

### Investigations

-   **Serum cortisol:** low morning level (\< 100 nmol/L is suggestive).\
-   **Plasma ACTH:** elevated in primary, low in secondary.\
-   **Electrolytes:** hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia.\
-   **ACTH stimulation test (Synacthen test):**
    -   Failure of cortisol to rise confirms adrenal insufficiency.\
-   **Adrenal autoantibodies** for autoimmune cause.\
-   **Imaging:** CT or MRI of the adrenal glands when a structural cause issuspected.

### Management

#### Acute Adrenal Crisis (Emergency)

**Presentation:** Shock, vomiting, dehydration, hypoglycaemia.

**Management steps:**

1.  Immediate IV access.\
2.  **Hydrocortisone:** 50 mg/m² IV stat, then 50–100 mg/m²/day divided q6h.\
3.  **IV fluids:** 0.9% saline with 5% dextrose for rehydration and glucose correction.\
4.  Correct electrolytes.\
5.  Identify and treat precipitating cause (infection, steroid withdrawal, stress).

#### Chronic Replacement Therapy

-   **Glucocorticoid:** Hydrocortisone 8–10 mg/m²/day orally (divided 3 doses).\
-   **Mineralocorticoid:** Fludrocortisone 0.05–0.2 mg daily.\
-   **Education:** “Sick day” rule—double or triple steroid dose during illness or surgery.\
-   **Monitoring:** Growth, weight, blood pressure, electrolytes.

## Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

### Definition

A group of **autosomal recessive** enzyme defects in cortisol biosynthesis, leading to cortisol
deficiency, variable aldosterone deficiency, and androgen excess.

### Most Common Type

-   **21-hydroxylase deficiency (≈90–95%)**

### Pathophysiology

-   Block in cortisol synthesis → increased ACTH → adrenal hyperplasia.\
-   Excess precursors diverted to androgen pathway → virilisation.\
-   In salt-wasting forms → aldosterone deficiency causes hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

### Classification

| Type                     | Features                                           |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Classical (Severe)**   | Salt-wasting or simple virilising                  |
| **Non-classical (Mild)** | Partial enzyme deficiency, late onset virilisation |

### Clinical Features

#### **Salt-wasting type**

-   Neonatal onset (first 2 weeks).\
-   Vomiting, dehydration, weight loss, shock.\
-   Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia.\
-   Female: ambiguous genitalia (virilisation).\
-   Male: normal genitalia but presents with adrenal crisis.

#### **Simple virilising type**

-   Ambiguous genitalia in females at birth.\
-   Precocious puberty, accelerated bone age.\
-   No salt wasting.

#### **Non-classical type**

-   Later onset (childhood/adolescence).\
-   Hirsutism, acne, irregular menses in girls.\
-   Early pubarche in boys.

### Diagnosis

-   **17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP):** elevated (\>30 nmol/L basal or post-ACTH).\
-   **Electrolytes:** hyponatremia, hyperkalemia.\
-   **Genetic testing:** CYP21A2 mutations.\
-   **Ultrasound:** assess internal genitalia in virilised females.

### Management

#### Hormone Replacement

-   **Hydrocortisone:** 10–15 mg/m²/day (3 divided doses).\
-   **Fludrocortisone:** 0.05–0.2 mg/day in salt-wasting forms.\
-   **Sodium supplementation:** especially in neonates.

#### Surgical Correction

-   **Genitoplasty** for virilised females (timing individualized).

#### Long-Term Care

-   Growth monitoring (avoid overtreatment leading to growth suppression).\
-   Periodic bone age assessment.\
-   Psychological and genetic counselling.\
-   Lifelong follow-up in endocrinology clinic.

## Cushing Syndrome

### Definition

A state of **chronic glucocorticoid excess**, either due to endogenous overproduction or exogenous
steroid use.

### Aetiology

| Type | Cause |
|----|----|
| **Exogenous** | Prolonged corticosteroid therapy (most common in children) |
| **Endogenous** | ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease), adrenal adenoma or carcinoma, ectopic ACTH secretion (rare) |

### Clinical Features

-   Growth failure and weight gain\
-   Moon facies, truncal obesity, buffalo hump\
-   Striae (purple), acne, hirsutism\
-   Hypertension, glucose intolerance\
-   Mood changes (depression, irritability)\
-   Osteopenia or fractures\
-   Delayed puberty or amenorrhea

### Investigations

1.  **Screening tests**
    -   24-hour urinary free cortisol: elevated.
    -   Late-night salivary cortisol: loss of diurnal variation.
    -   Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test: failure to suppress cortisol.
2.  **Differentiation tests**
    -   Plasma ACTH:
        -   Low → adrenal cause\
        -   Normal/high → ACTH-dependent cause.
3.  **Imaging**
    -   MRI pituitary (Cushing disease).\
    -   CT or MRI adrenals for adenoma/carcinoma.

### Management

-   **Exogenous:** Gradual tapering of steroid dose.\
-   **Pituitary adenoma:** Trans-sphenoidal surgery.\
-   **Adrenal tumour:** Surgical excision ± radiotherapy.\
-   **Medical therapy:** Ketoconazole, metyrapone, or mitotane when surgery is contraindicated.

### Prognosis

-   Normal growth may resume post-treatment, but final height may be compromised if prolonged
    disease.\
-   Requires careful perioperative steroid coverage to prevent adrenal insufficiency.

## Adrenal Tumours

### Overview

Adrenal tumours in children may be **benign (adenoma)** or **malignant (carcinoma)**, and may
secrete hormones or be non-functioning.

#### Adrenocortical Tumours

-   **Adenomas:** often hormonally active (Cushing, virilisation).\
-   **Carcinomas:** aggressive, may secrete multiple hormones.

**Clinical features:**

-   Rapid virilisation in girls.\
-   Cushingoid features.\
-   Precocious puberty in boys.\
-   Abdominal mass or pain.

**Diagnosis:**

-   Elevated serum and urinary steroid precursors.\
-   Imaging (CT/MRI): large irregular mass.\
-   Histopathology confirms diagnosis.

**Treatment:**

-   Surgical excision is mainstay.\
-   Chemotherapy for carcinoma (mitotane, cisplatin-based regimens).\
-   Lifelong hormonal follow-up.

#### Neuroblastoma

A malignant tumour arising from **neural crest cells** of the adrenal medulla.

**Clinical features:**

-   Abdominal mass, weight loss, hypertension.\
-   Opsoclonus–myoclonus syndrome (rare paraneoplastic sign).

**Investigations:**

-   Elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites (VMA, HVA).\
-   Imaging: calcified adrenal mass.\
-   Bone marrow or MIBG scan for metastases.

**Treatment:**

-   Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy as appropriate.\
-   Prognosis depends on stage and age (better in \<1 year).

## Disorders of the Adrenal Medulla

### Pheochromocytoma

A rare catecholamine-secreting tumour of chromaffin cells.

#### Clinical Features

-   Paroxysmal or sustained hypertension.\
-   Headache, palpitations, sweating.\
-   Pallor, tremor, anxiety.\
-   May be part of **MEN2A/2B syndromes**.

#### Investigations

-   24-hour urinary **metanephrines and catecholamines** (diagnostic).\
-   Plasma free metanephrines.\
-   MRI or MIBG scan to localize tumour.

#### Management

1.  **Preoperative preparation:**

    -   Alpha-blockade (phenoxybenzamine) for 1–2 weeks.\
    -   Then beta-blocker (propranolol) if tachycardia.

2.  **Definitive surgery:** Adrenalectomy.\

3.  **Postoperative monitoring** for hypotension or recurrence.

## Investigation Summary Table

| Disorder              | Key Test                  | Diagnostic Findings          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Adrenal insufficiency | ACTH stimulation          | Low cortisol response        |
| CAH                   | 17-hydroxyprogesterone    | Elevated                     |
| Cushing syndrome      | Dexamethasone suppression | Failure to suppress cortisol |
| Adrenocortical tumour | Urinary steroids, imaging | Elevated androgens/cortisol  |
| Pheochromocytoma      | Urinary metanephrines     | Elevated catecholamines      |

## Long-Term Management Considerations

-   **Hormone replacement therapy** requires frequent adjustment as the child grows.\
-   **Stress dosing** of steroids during illness or surgery is lifesaving.\
-   **Growth monitoring** is crucial to avoid overtreatment or under-replacement.\
-   **Psychological support** is vital for children with virilisation or chronic illness.\
-   **Family education** on emergency management (e.g., injectable hydrocortisone) is essential.

## Summary Points

-   Adrenal gland disorders in children range from life-threatening adrenal insufficiency to
    hormone-secreting tumours.\
-   **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia** is the most frequent inherited adrenal disorder.\
-   **Adrenal crisis** is a paediatric emergency; treat promptly with IV fluids and hydrocortisone.\
-   **Cushing syndrome** in children commonly results from exogenous steroids.\
-   **Pheochromocytoma**, though rare, should be suspected in children with unexplained
    hypertension.\
-   Lifelong follow-up and interdisciplinary care (paediatric endocrinology, surgery, psychology)
    improve outcomes.
