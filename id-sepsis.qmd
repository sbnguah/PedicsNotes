## Definition

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by organ dysfunction resulting from a
dysregulated host response to infection. In children, it presents a range of disorders caused by
bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. Septic shock, a severe form of sepsis, is defined
by persistent hypotension that requires vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥
65 mmHg and a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L, despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

## Incidence and Prevalence

Sepsis continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children around the globe. As
stated by the World Health Organization (WHO), sepsis plays a significant role in childhood
mortality, especially in low-resource environments. The incidence varies by region, with higher
rates observed in neonates and infants due to their immature immune systems.

## Aetiology

Sepsis can result from infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The most common
bacterial pathogens vary by age:

-   Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: *Streptococcus agalactiae*, *Escherichia coli*, *Haemophilus
    influenzae*, *Listeria monocytogenes*.
-   Infant Sepsis: *Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)*, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Neisseria
    meningitidis*, *Salmonella* species.
-   Late-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: *Staphylococcus aureus*, *E. coli*, *Klebsiella* species,
    *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Candida* species.

## Pathogenesis

Sepsis results from a dysregulated immune response to infection, leading to widespread tissue
injury. The process involves:

1.  **Immune Dysregulation:** Excessive release of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators.
2.  **Microcirculatory Derangements:** Increased vascular permeability, leading to hypotension and
    organ dysfunction.
3.  **End-Organ Damage:** Progression to multi-organ failure due to poor perfusion.

## Signs and Symptoms

Early recognition is crucial, as sepsis can progress rapidly. Symptoms include:

-   Fever or Hypothermia
-   Tachycardia and Tachypnea
-   Altered Mental Status
-   Hypotension
-   Cool Extremities
-   Petechial or Purpuric Rash (suggestive of meningococcal sepsis)
-   Oliguria or Anuria (kidney dysfunction).

## Investigations

A thorough **laboratory workup** is essential for diagnosis:

-   **Blood Tests:** Complete Blood Count (CBC), Blood Culture, Blood Gas Analysis (including
    lactate levels).
-   **Urine Analysis:** Dipstick, Routine Examination, Culture.
-   **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis:** Culture and Sensitivity.
-   **Coagulation Studies:** To assess disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
-   **Inflammatory Markers:** C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), Interleukins (IL-1b,
    IL-6, IL-8), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha.

## Treatment

Early antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation are critical:

-   **Empirical Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics:** Based on suspected pathogens.
-   **Fluid Resuscitation:** Crystalloids (e.g., normal saline or Ringer’s lactate).
-   **Vasopressors:** If hypotension persists despite fluids.
-   **Supportive Care:** Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy if
    needed.

## Complications

Sepsis can lead to multi-organ failure and death if untreated. Common complications include:

-   Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
-   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
-   Renal Failure
-   Cardiac Dysfunction
-   Neurological Sequelae (e.g., cognitive impairment post-sepsis).

## Prognosis

The mortality rate varies based on early recognition and intervention. Neonatal sepsis has a higher
fatality rate, especially in low-resource settings. Survivors may experience long-term
complications, including neurodevelopmental delays.

## Differential Diagnosis

Sepsis must be distinguished from other conditions with similar presentations:

-   Meningitis
-   Severe Pneumonia
-   Hemorrhagic Shock
-   Metabolic Disorders
-   Autoimmune Diseases.

### Clinical Scenario 1: Neonatal Sepsis

A 5-day-old male infant presents with lethargy, poor feeding, respiratory distress, and a fever of
38.5°C. On examination, the infant appears jaundiced, with cool extremities and tachypnea. The
mother had a prolonged rupture of membranes (\>18 hours) before delivery, and the infant had
meconium-stained amniotic fluid.

Key Considerations:

-   **Etiology:** Early-onset neonatal sepsis, likely *Streptococcus agalactiae* (Group B Strep) or
    *Escherichia coli*.
-   **Investigations:** Blood cultures, CBC, CRP, procalcitonin, serum lactate, and lumbar puncture
    for CSF culture.
-   **Management:** **Empirical IV antibiotics** (Ampicillin + Gentamicin), fluid resuscitation,
    oxygen therapy, and supportive care.
-   **Complications:** Risk of meningitis and multi-organ failure if untreated.

### Clinical Scenario 2: Pediatric Septic Shock

A 6-year-old girl presents with a history of fever (40°C) for 3 days, altered mental status, and
poor urine output. She is tachycardic (HR: 150 bpm), hypotensive (BP: 75/50 mmHg), and has delayed
capillary refill (\>3 seconds). A petechial rash is noted on the lower extremities.

Key Considerations:

-   **Etiology:** Meningococcal sepsis (*Neisseria meningitidis*) suspected.
-   **Investigations:** Blood culture, CBC, coagulation studies, lactate, kidney function tests, and
    inflammatory markers.
-   **Management:** **IV Ceftriaxone**, aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressors if needed, and
    close monitoring in ICU.
-   **Complications:** Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), Acute Respiratory Distress
    Syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure
