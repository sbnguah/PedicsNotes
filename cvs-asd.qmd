## Introduction

An Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) is a defect in the wall separating the left and right atria.

## Incidence/Prevalence

It is the third most common congenital heart disease and may occur in as much as 25% of all
congenital heart disease patients. It is thought to have a small female preponderance but in a
compilation of all electrocardiogram cases in Kumasi, it formed 26% of the patients and showed no
difference in incidence between sexes. There are 4 main types, Secundum ASD (50-70%), Primum ASD
(\~30%), Sinus Venosus ASD and Coronary sinus ASD. @fig-csv-asdSc

## Aetiology

Most ASDs are thought to occur sporadically but here are recorded associations with some genetic
defects and syndromes. [@caputo2005] Prominent among these are Holt-Oram, Noonan, Down, and
Budd-Chiari syndrome.

## Pathophysiology

Since the pressure in the left atrium is higher than that of the right, there is shunting from the
high oxygen-content blood in the left atrium to the right atrium. Thus an uncomplicated ADS is
**acyanotic**. The shunting also leads to volume overload of the right atrium, right ventricle,
pulmonary artery and lungs. This consequent results in dilatation of the right atrium, right
ventricle and pulmonary artery, and pulmonary oedema. The low pressure in the atria implies low
pressure in the right ventricle, pulmonary artery and lungs. This reduces the extent of pulmonary
oedema and subsequently overt heart failure in a child with ASD, compared to other congenital heart
defects such as ventricular septal defects.

-   Minimal pressure transmitted so no significant pressure overload
-   Consequently, pulmonary oedema is usually insignificant
-   Rarely have overt heart failure
-   However, long-standing liaison or a very big lesion with a pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio of 2
    or more will lead to heart failure and pulmonary hypertension after about 15 to 20 years no
    reversal of the shunt

## Clinical presentation

-   Usually asymptomatic except for big lesion with high Qp: Qs
-   They often have slender bodies
-   Auscultation reveals a widely fixed split-second heart sound and a grade 2/6 to 3/6 ejection
    systolic murmur at the upper sternal border
-   Many are almost silent, especially the small lesions which are often detected during an
    echocardiogram for another reason

## Investigations

-   Bedside SpO2 is usually normal and hence an acyanotic heart disease
-   In older patients, a chest x-ray may show
    -   Cardiomegaly
    -   Prominent pulmonary artery
    -   Increased vascular markings
-   The electrocardiogram may show
    -   Right axis deviation due to the right ventricular dilatation
    -   Right atrial enlargement
-   An echocardiogram is diagnostic as it visualises the defect, and quantifies the shunt and other
    chamber sizes.
-   Cardiac catheterization is often donow!e in long-standing cases to detect complications that may
    have arisen.

## Natural history

-   Most ASDs will close spontaneously by 4 years, with smaller ones having a higher closure rate
    than bigger ones. A long-standing large defect however leads to chronic heart failure and
    pulmonary hypertension in early adulthood.
-   Arrhythmias may arise because of the dilated right atrium.
-   Though there are reported cases of paradoxical strokes in patients with ASDs, it remains an
    uncommon occurrence.
-   Infective endocarditis is rare in ASDs.

## Treatment

There is no need for exercise restriction or prophylaxis for endocarditis. If there is no sign of
heart failure, a device closure is often done after infancy or a surgical closure at 2-4 years of
age. However, if there is heart failure, Medical treatment for heart failure is immediately
instituted. Then a planned device closure or surgical closure can be done within the first year of
life.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is generally good with many living into adulthood even without corrective surgery.
Post-surgical mortality is currently less than 0.5%. The patient will need little long-term
follow-up after the corrective surgery.
