## **Definition**

The inability of the heat to provide enough output to the body.

## **Causes**

Varies especially in children. They can occur in both structurally normal hearts and in congenital
cardiac malformations. There are 3 main groups of causes:

1.  Ventricular dysfunction: This is where there is a dysfunction of the ventricles. It is usually a
    systolic dysfunction but may also be diastolic. Examples are:

    -   Cardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive and hypertrophic)
    -   Myocarditis
    -   Arrhythmias
    -   Coronary artery anomalies
    -   Post-op cardiac dysfunction

2.  Volume overload: This occurs in conditions associated with increased volume (preload) in the
    heart especially the ventricles. The ventricle must therefore eject an increased blood volume,
    leading to tachycardia. It may or may not be associated with ventricular dysfunction. Examples
    include:

    -   Ventricular septal defect (left to right shunt)
    -   Atrial septal defect
    -   Patent ductus arteriosus
    -   Aortic regurgitation (left ventricle)
    -   Mitral regurgitation (Left atrium)

3.  Pressure overload: This is when heart failure is caused by an increased pressure (afterload) in
    the heart. Ventricles must therefore contract against higher pressures. It may or may not be
    associated with ventricular dysfunction. These include:

    -   Hypertension
    -   Aortic valve stenosis
    -   PulmonaryÂ  stenosis
    -   Coarctation of the aorta

In all these, the result is decreased cardiac output and pulmonary oedema.

## Classification

The symptoms of heart failure vary significantly with infants and young children having different
presentations compared to older children. The classification of heart failure there is not uniform.
The most well-known classification is the NYHA classification which is appropriate for older
children. It is shown below:

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Class                 | Patient Symptoms                                                         |
+=======================+==========================================================================+
| Class I (Mild)        | No limitation on physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not  |
|                       | cause undue fatigue, palpitation or dyspnoea                             |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Class II (Mild)       | Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest but ordinary |
|                       | physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation or dyspnoea            |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Class III (Moderate)  | Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest but less     |
|                       | than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation or dyspnoea  |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Class IV (Severe)     | Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms   |
|                       | of cardiac insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken |
|                       | discomfort is increased                                                  |

: NYHA Classification

On the other hand, the Ross classification shown below is more suited for infants and young
children.

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Class                 | Symptoms                                                                 |
+=======================+==========================================================================+
| Class I               | Asymptomatic                                                             |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Class II              | Mild tachypnoea or diaphoresis in feeding in infants                     |
|                       |                                                                          |
|                       | Dyspnoea on exertion in older children                                   |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Class III             | Marked tachypnoea or sweating with feeding in infants                    |
|                       |                                                                          |
|                       | Marked dyspnoea on exertion                                              |
|                       |                                                                          |
|                       | Prolonged feeding times with growth failure                              |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Class IV              | Symptoms such as tachycardia, retraction, grunting, or diaphoresis at    |
|                       | rest                                                                     |
