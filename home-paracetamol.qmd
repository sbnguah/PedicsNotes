## Introduction

Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) is one of the most commonly used over-the-counter
medications for fever and pain in children. While generally safe at therapeutic doses, **paracetamol
poisoning** can lead to **life-threatening hepatotoxicity** if taken in excessive amounts.

In Ghana and similar settings, where self-medication and delayed health-seeking behaviors are
common, cases of **accidental or intentional ingestion** are frequently encountered. This makes it
essential for every medical student to understand the presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and
management of paracetamol poisoning.

## Epidemiology

-   Common cause of **drug overdose in children** globally.
-   In children under 6, most cases are **accidental**.
-   In adolescents, intentional ingestion may indicate **suicidal ideation**.
-   Easy availability and parental unawareness of correct dosing contribute to risk.
-   Liquid formulations (e.g., syrups) and tablets are common sources.

## Toxic Dose

**Therapeutic dose:**

-   **10–15 mg/kg per dose**, up to **60 mg/kg/day** in children.

**Toxic dose:**

-   **Single ingestion of ≥150 mg/kg** in children is considered **potentially toxic**.
-   In neonates and infants, even **lower doses may cause toxicity** due to immature liver
    metabolism.

## Pathophysiology

Paracetamol is primarily metabolized in the liver by

1.  **Glucuronidation** and **sulfation** → Non-toxic metabolites (90%)
2.  **Cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP2E1)** → Minor pathway forms a **toxic metabolite** called **NAPQI
    (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine)**

**In therapeutic doses**

-   NAPQI is rapidly detoxified by **glutathione**

**In overdose:**

-   Glutathione stores are **depleted**
-   NAPQI accumulates → **Hepatocellular damage**, centrilobular necrosis
-   Severe cases can lead to **acute liver failure**, **coagulopathy**, and **death**

## Clinical Features

Paracetamol toxicity has a **four-phase clinical progression**:

**Phase I (0–24 hours) – *Asymptomatic or mild GI symptoms***

-   Nausea, vomiting
-   Anorexia
-   Pallor, lethargy
-   Most children appear **well**

**Phase II (24–72 hours) – *Hepatic injury begins***

-   Right upper quadrant pain or tenderness
-   Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
-   Prolonged prothrombin time (PT)
-   Oliguria (renal involvement)

**Phase III (72–96 hours) – *Maximum hepatotoxicity***

-   Jaundice
-   Hepatic encephalopathy
-   Bleeding (coagulopathy)
-   Hypoglycemia
-   Acute kidney injury
-   Multi-organ failure

**Phase IV (4–14 days) – *Recovery or death***

-   Complete recovery in survivors
-   Liver regeneration may take weeks

## Risk Factors for Severe Poisoning

-   **Delayed presentation (\>8 hours)**
-   **Repeated supratherapeutic dosing**
-   Malnutrition (reduced glutathione reserves)
-   Pre-existing liver disease (e.g., hepatitis B)
-   Concomitant use of enzyme inducers (e.g., anti-TB drugs)

## Diagnosis

**Clinical history:**

-   Time, dose, and formulation of paracetamol ingested
-   Number of tablets or volume of syrup
-   Co-ingestants (e.g., alcohol, antihistamines)
-   Symptoms since ingestion

**Physical examination**

-   Vital signs, signs of hepatic dysfunction
-   Abdominal tenderness (RUQ)
-   Jaundice, mental status (encephalopathy)

**Laboratory investigations:**

-   **Serum paracetamol level** (at 4 hours post-ingestion)
-   **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: ALT, AST, bilirubin
-   **Prothrombin time / INR**
-   **Serum creatinine and urea** (renal function)
-   **Blood glucose**
-   **Electrolytes**
-   **Arterial blood gas** (if acidosis suspected)

## Rumack-Matthew Nomogram

Used to interpret **serum paracetamol levels** and determine need for **antidote**.

-   Plot serum paracetamol level against time since ingestion (only valid for **single acute
    ingestions**)
-   A level **above the "treatment line"** (150 µg/mL at 4 hours) indicates need for
    **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)**

Not applicable for

-   Ingestion \<4 hours or \>24 hours ago
-   Repeated supratherapeutic ingestion
-   Extended-release formulations

## Management

### Initial Stabilization

1.  **Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABCs)**
2.  **Vital signs monitoring**
3.  **IV access**
4.  **Activated charcoal**:
    -   Indicated if child presents **within 1 hour** of ingestion
    -   Dose: 1 g/kg (maximum 50 g)
    -   Only if **airway is protected**

## Antidote – N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)

**Mechanism:**

-   Replenishes **glutathione stores**
-   Enhances non-toxic metabolism of NAPQI

**Indications:**

-   Serum level above treatment line on nomogram
-   Unknown ingestion time + raised LFTs
-   Clinical signs of hepatotoxicity
-   Suspected ingestion \>150 mg/kg

**NAC Administration**

**IV Route (preferred in children):**

-   **Loading dose**: 150 mg/kg over 1 hour
-   **Then**: 50 mg/kg over 4 hours
-   **Then**: 100 mg/kg over 16 hours (total = 300 mg/kg over 21 hours)

**Oral Route (if IV not available):**

-   140 mg/kg loading dose
-   Then 70 mg/kg every 4 hours × 17 doses (total = 1330 mg/kg over 72 hours)
-   Unpalatable and may induce vomiting

## Supportive Care

-   **IV fluids**: for dehydration or shock
-   **Glucose**: to prevent/treat hypoglycemia
-   **Vitamin K** or FFP: for coagulopathy
-   **Dialysis**: for renal failure or severe acidosis
-   **Liver transplant**: in fulminant hepatic failure (not readily available in Ghana)

## Monitoring

-   **Liver enzymes** every 12–24 hours
-   **INR**, **glucose**, **renal function**
-   Mental status (for encephalopathy)
-   Continue NAC until clinical and biochemical improvement

## Disposition

|                                       |                                          |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Scenario**                          | **Action**                               |
| Ingestion \<150 mg/kg, asymptomatic   | Observe for 4–6 hours, discharge if well |
| Ingestion \>150 mg/kg, \<8 hours ago  | Begin NAC                                |
| Ingestion \>24 hours ago, symptomatic | Treat as hepatic injury, give NAC        |
| Intentional overdose                  | Admit, psychiatric evaluation            |

## Prevention Strategies

-   **Public education**: About correct pediatric dosing
-   **Child-proof containers**
-   **Proper labeling** of medications
-   **Avoid overlapping medications** with paracetamol content (e.g., cold and pain meds)
-   Educate parents to **seek medical attention early** after overdose

## Special Considerations in Ghana

-   Limited access to **serum paracetamol assays**: clinical judgment and reported dose guide
    treatment
-   NAC may not always be readily available – advocate for stocking in **district and regional
    hospitals**
-   **Traditional medicines** may contain unknown paracetamol content – careful history is important
-   Early transfer to **higher-level facilities** for severe cases
-   Community education on **risks of overmedication and self-medication**

## Case Scenario

**Case 1: 3-year-old girl**

**Presentation:**

-   Mother reports child accidentally drank 10 teaspoons of paracetamol syrup (120 mg/5 ml) ≈ 1200
    mg
-   Weight: 12 kg → Toxic dose = 1800 mg (150 mg/kg)
-   Child appears well; ingestion occurred 2 hours ago

**Action:**

-   Calculate dose: 1200 mg ÷ 12 kg = 100 mg/kg
-   Below toxic threshold → Observe for 4–6 hours
-   No NAC needed
-   Educate mother on correct dosing

**Case 2: 13-year-old girl (suicidal ingestion)**

**Presentation:**

-   Took 20 x 500 mg tablets (10,000 mg) 4 hours ago
-   Weight: 40 kg → Dose = 250 mg/kg (toxic)
-   Nausea, abdominal pain
-   Start IV NAC
-   Check LFTs, INR, glucose
-   Admit and arrange psychiatric evaluation

## Summary Table

|                            |                                |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Parameter**              | **Value**                      |
| Safe dose                  | 10–15 mg/kg/dose               |
| Maximum daily dose         | 60 mg/kg/day                   |
| Toxic dose                 | \>150 mg/kg (single ingestion) |
| Antidote                   | N-acetylcysteine (NAC)         |
| NAC IV dose                | 300 mg/kg over 21 hours        |
| Serum level interpretation | Rumack-Matthew nomogram        |
| Onset of liver injury      | 24–72 hours post-ingestion     |
| Outcome                    | Excellent if treated early     |

## Conclusion

Paracetamol poisoning is **common, preventable**, and **potentially fatal** if not recognized and
treated early. Prompt administration of **N-acetylcysteine** can prevent liver failure even in
significant overdoses. In Ghana, clinical assessment remains the cornerstone due to limited
laboratory resources. Medical students must be vigilant, advocate for early treatment, and educate
caregivers on safe medication practices.
