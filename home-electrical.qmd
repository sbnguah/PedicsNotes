## Introduction

Electrical injuries are significant but often under-recognised causes of morbidity and mortality in
children. They occur when electric current passes through the body, causing a spectrum of damage
ranging from minor superficial burns to catastrophic multi-organ injury and death.
Children—particularly toddlers and school-aged boys—are at higher risk due to exploratory behaviour,
accidental contact with faulty wiring, and unsafe household electrical installations.

In Ghana and many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the risk of electrical injuries is heightened by
several contextual realities: exposed electrical wires in homes, non-compliant installations, poorly
maintained appliances, unprotected power outlets, illegal connections, and the proliferation of
artisanal repair shops. Rural electrification projects and urban slum environments also contribute
to unsafe electrical exposure. As a result, paediatric emergency units in districts, regional
hospitals, and tertiary facilities regularly encounter children with electrical burns, arrhythmias,
tetanic muscle contractions, and associated trauma.

This chapter comprehensively reviews the mechanisms, pathophysiology, clinical patterns, management
principles, complications, and prevention of electrical injuries in children, integrating
Ghana-specific context for clinicians working in resource-variable environments.

## Basic Electrical Concepts Relevant to Injury

Understanding electrical principles helps clinicians anticipate the pattern and severity of injury.

### Voltage

-   **Low voltage**: \<1000 volts (typical household current: 110–240V)
-   **High voltage**: ≥1000 volts (industrial lines, transformers)

Low-voltage injuries are more common in homes, while high-voltage injuries, though less frequent,
cause far more severe and deep tissue damage.

### Current Type

-   **Alternating Current (AC)**: Used in households; more dangerous because it causes tetanic
    muscle contractions, which may “freeze” the child to the source.
-   **Direct Current (DC)**: Causes a single muscular contraction that often throws the child away
    from the source, sometimes resulting in secondary trauma.

### Amperage

The most important determinant of injury severity.\
As little as **0.1–0.2 amperes** passing through the heart can cause ventricular fibrillation.

### Resistance

Body tissues vary in resistance:

-   High resistance: skin, fat, bone\
-   Low resistance: nerves, vessels, muscle, mucous membranes

Wet skin dramatically lowers resistance, making children more vulnerable to severe injury during
bathing, rainy conditions, or contact with wet surfaces.

## Mechanisms of Injury

Electrical injuries involve multiple simultaneous processes:

### **Direct Electrical Damage**

Electric current disrupts cell membranes and causes immediate necrosis of nerves, vessels, muscle,
and organs.

### **Thermal Injury**

Conversion of electrical energy into heat can cause deep burns that extend beyond what is visible on
the skin.

### **Mechanical Injury**

Tetanic muscle contractions may result in:

-   Fractures\
-   Dislocations\
-   Falls from heights\
-   Blunt trauma

### **Cardiac Effects**

Current passing through the thorax can cause:

-   Ventricular fibrillation\
-   Asystole\
-   Conduction abnormalities

### **Respiratory Arrest**

From tetanic paralysis of respiratory muscles or central nervous system disruption.

### **Myonecrosis and Rhabdomyolysis**

High-voltage injuries can cause massive muscle breakdown leading to acute kidney injury (AKI).

## Epidemiology and Local Context in Ghana

Children aged **1–5 years** are most vulnerable due to curiosity and hand-to-mouth interactions.
School-aged boys (6–12 years) are at higher risk of outdoor incidents, such as contact with fallen
power lines or tampering with electrical equipment.

**Key Ghana-specific risk factors include:**

-   Exposed sockets and non-childproof outlets.
-   Use of extension boards without protective covers.
-   Faulty electrical wiring, common in low-income households.
-   Overloaded sockets during power fluctuations or generator use.
-   Illegal connections (“tapping light”) with poorly insulated wires.
-   Contact with fallen power lines during heavy rains.
-   Burns during attempted repairs by untrained individuals.

The combination of inadequate regulation and widespread informal electrical work creates a unique
risk environment for children.

## Classification of Electrical Injuries

Electrical injuries in children can be categorised as:

1.  **Low-voltage household injuries**
    -   Most common in toddlers.
    -   Often involve oral commissure burns from chewing charger cables or cords.
2.  **High-voltage industrial or outdoor injuries**
    -   Cause deep tissue damage, rhabdomyolysis, limb ischemia.
    -   Common in children playing near transformers or climbing trees near power lines.
3.  **Lightning strikes**
    -   Rare but deadly.
    -   Often associated with mass casualties in rural communities.
4.  **Flash burns (arc injuries)**
    -   Occur without direct contact.
    -   Caused by electrical arcs generating intense heat.

## Pathophysiology

The pattern of injury depends on voltage, resistance, current pathway, and duration of contact.

### Current Pathway

Determines the organs affected:

-   **Hand-to-hand** or **hand-to-foot** pathways may cross the thorax → risk of arrhythmia.
-   **Mouth-to-hand** injuries in toddlers → severe facial burns and feeding difficulties.
-   **Head-to-foot** pathways → highest risk of brain and spinal cord injury.

### Skin Burns Do Not Predict Severity

Electrical burns often appear deceptively small. Deep muscle necrosis may exist beneath a tiny entry
wound. For this reason, the clinical evaluation must not be guided solely by external findings.

### Rhabdomyolysis

High-voltage electrical injury leads to: - Muscle breakdown\
- Release of myoglobin\
- Renal tubular obstruction\
- Acute kidney injury

## Clinical Presentation

Children present with a wide range of symptoms depending on the severity of injury.

### General Symptoms

-   Burns at entry and exit sites\
-   Pain or numbness\
-   Weakness\
-   Arrhythmias\
-   Loss of consciousness\
-   Respiratory distress\
-   Seizures\
-   Myoglobinuria (dark urine)

### Cardiac Manifestations

-   Ventricular fibrillation\
-   Tachyarrhythmias\
-   AV block\
-   Asystole

Cardiac arrest at the scene is the most common cause of death.

### Neurological Manifestations

-   Confusion\
-   Seizures\
-   Peripheral neuropathy\
-   Spinal cord injury\
    Some children develop delayed neurological deficits days to weeks later.

### Skin and Soft Tissue Injury

-   Entry and exit wounds\
-   Deep tissue necrosis\
-   Compartment syndrome\
-   Limb ischaemia

### Oral Commissure Burns (Common in Toddlers)

Caused by chewing electrical cords.\
Complications: - Bleeding when eschar separates\
- Microstomia\
- Feeding difficulty\
- Cosmetic deformity

### Secondary Trauma

Including fractures, head injury, and soft tissue damage due to falls.

## Investigations

Investigations are tailored to the severity of the injury.

### Essential Tests

-   **ECG** for all patients\
-   **Urinalysis** for myoglobin\
-   **Serum electrolytes and renal function**\
-   **CK and myoglobin**

### Additional Tests (as indicated)

-   Full Blood Count\
-   Chest X-ray (if inhalation injury or arrhythmia suspected)\
-   Echocardiography (if chest pain or arrhythmia)\
-   CT/MRI if neurological deficit\
-   Doppler ultrasound for limb vascular compromise

### Monitoring

Children with moderate-to-severe injuries should be observed for: - Arrhythmias (continuous ECG
monitoring)\
- AKI (urine output, creatinine)\
- Compartment syndrome

## Management

Management begins with immediate stabilisation, followed by detailed evaluation and treatment of
burns, cardiac complications, and systemic injury.

## Initial Stabilisation

### **Ensure Scene Safety**

Do not touch the child until the electrical source is deactivated.\
High-voltage injuries require safety clearance from the electricity company.

### **Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABCs)**

-   Give high-flow oxygen.\
-   Secure airway if the child has inhalation injury, altered mental status, or respiratory
    distress.\
-   Provide fluid resuscitation according to burn protocols or rhabdomyolysis risk.

## **Control Active Arrhythmias**

-   Follow paediatric advanced life support protocols.\
-   Defibrillate ventricular fibrillation promptly.

## Specific Management

### 1. **Burn Care**

-   Clean wounds with saline.\
-   Apply non-adherent dressings.\
-   Elevate limbs to reduce swelling.\
-   Provide analgesia (paracetamol, opioids if needed).\
-   Avoid topical agents that interfere with wound assessment.

#### Surgical referral is required for:

-   Deep partial or full-thickness burns\
-   Compartment syndrome\
-   Limb ischemia requiring fasciotomy\
-   Debridement of necrotic tissue

### **Fluid Management**

Children with high-voltage injuries or rhabdomyolysis need aggressive hydration: - Aim for urine
output of **1–2 mL/kg/hour**.\
- Use IV crystalloids.\
- Consider sodium bicarbonate infusion if myoglobinuria is significant.

### **Management of Oral Commissure Burns**

-   Maintain oral hygiene.\
-   Apply soft dressings.\
-   Monitor for bleeding when eschar separates.\
-   Speech and feeding support as needed.

### **Pain Management**

-   IV analgesics for severe burns.\
-   Avoid NSAIDs in AKI or rhabdomyolysis.

### **Antibiotics**

Not routinely recommended unless: - Infection is present\
- Open wounds with contamination\
- Surgical debridement

### **Tetanus Prophylaxis**

Administer according to immunisation status.

### **Management of Compartment Syndrome**

High-voltage injuries may cause large amounts of muscle swelling.\
Signs include:

-   Pain out of proportion to injury\
-   Palpable tenseness\
-   Distal neurovascular compromise

Immediate fasciotomy is required.

### **Renal Protection**

-   Maintain adequate hydration.\
-   Monitor creatinine closely.\
-   Treat rhabdomyolysis aggressively to prevent AKI.

## Complications

Electrical injuries can lead to severe, long-term complications.

### Acute Complications

-   Cardiac arrest\
-   Respiratory arrest\
-   Arrhythmias\
-   Shock\
-   Seizures\
-   Rhabdomyolysis\
-   AKI\
-   Compartment syndrome\
-   Limb ischaemia and need for amputation

### Chronic Complications

-   Peripheral neuropathy\
-   Cognitive impairment\
-   Chronic pain\
-   Cataracts (weeks to years later, especially after high-voltage injury)\
-   Scarring and contractures\
-   Oral commissure deformities\
-   Growth disturbances in injured limbs

Children require long-term follow-up by a multidisciplinary team.

## Prevention

Preventive strategies are crucial to reducing the burden of electrical injuries.

### Household Interventions

-   Childproof outlets.\
-   Keep cords out of reach.\
-   Replace frayed wires.\
-   Avoid using exposed extension boards.\
-   Supervise toddlers, especially during rainy seasons.

### Community and Policy Strategies

-   Strengthen electrical installation regulations.\
-   Public education via CHPS compounds and community durbars.\
-   Enforcement against illegal connections.\
-   Safe playground design.\
-   School curricula incorporating electrical safety education.

### Industry and Utility-Level Measures

-   Regular maintenance of transformers and power lines.\
-   Prompt removal of fallen electrical cables.\
-   Rapid response during storms or power surges.

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on voltage exposure, current pathway, duration of exposure, and timeliness of
resuscitation.\
Key prognostic indicators include:

-   Presence of cardiac arrest at the scene\
-   Deep tissue necrosis\
-   Rhabdomyolysis and AKI\
-   Neurological impairment\
-   Extent of burns

Children who survive the acute phase may still experience lifelong disability, psychosocial
difficulties, cosmetic deformities, and chronic pain.

## Key Points

-   Electrical injuries in children range from minor burns to multi-organ failure.\
-   Voltage, current pathway, and duration of contact determine severity.\
-   Cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory arrest are leading causes of mortality.\
-   High-voltage injuries require aggressive fluid management and assessment for compartment
    syndrome.\
-   Oral commissure burns are characteristic of toddlers chewing electrical cords.\
-   Prevention is essential and must be community-driven, regulatory, and household-based.
