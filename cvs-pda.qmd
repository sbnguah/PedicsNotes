## Definition

Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) is an acyanotic congenital heart disease. that results from the
persistence into the post-natal life of the normal fetal vascular conduit between the pulmonary and
systemic arterial systems. @fig-cvs-pda Normally, the ductus arteriosus functionally closes within
the first 1-3 days after birth. Structural closure is usually completed by the 3^rd^ week of birth.

## Incidence/prevalence

PDAs represent about 5-10% of all congenital heart defects, with an equal male-to-female
ratio.[@borges-lujan2022] It made up 23% of all electrocardiograph diagnoses of heart diseases seen
in Kumasi, with a male-female-ratio of 1:0.9. This high proportion of PDAs in this cohort could be
because a significant proportion of the children scanned were preterm infants.

## Aetiology

Although there are no recognized etiological factors, PDAs are associated with a few recognisable
conditions. These include:

1.  **Prematurity** - The more premature a baby is the higher the incidence of PDA. it is seen in as
    much as 80% of babies born from 24 to 28 weeks.
2.  **Teratogenic agents** such as Congenital Rubella, fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal hydantoin
    syndrome and maternal phenylketonuria
3.  **Genetic or familial** factors such as Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13, Noonan syndrome,
    CHARGE association, VATER association, Holt-Oram syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, PHACE
    Syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Cri du chat syndrome
4.  **Living at high altitudes** has long been associated with a higher incidence of PDAs
5.  **Idiopathic** - Many patients with a PDA have no identifiable risk factors.

## Pathophysiology

Ductus arteriosus in fetal circulation is indispensable to allow right-to-left shunting of
nutrient-rich oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetal systemic circulation, bypassing the
fetal pulmonary circuit. At birth, the rise in PaO~2~ and decline in prostaglandin concentration
cause closure of the ductus arteriosus, typically beginning within the first 10 to 15 hours of life.
If this normal process does not occur, the ductus arteriosus will remain patent. The PDA then
results in excess blood shunting from the aorta, across the duct and into the pulmonary artery. This
shunting causes volume overload. There is therefore a circuit of excess blood volume in the
pulmonary arteries, lungs, left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta. This subsequently leads to
dilatation of the left pulmonary artery, left atrium and left ventricle as well as pulmonary edema
and heart failure.

## Signs and symptoms

Symptoms vary based on the volume of additional blood flow to the lungs.

1.  The degree of the shunt depends on:
    -   The size of the PDA (including diameter, length, and tortuosity). Bigger ducts with shorter
        lengths often result in worse symptoms. Conversely, patients with small PDAs are often
        asymptomatic.
    -   Pulmonary vascular resistance when high does not encourage shunting across the duct.
        However, as the resistance drops the shunt gets worse, with worsening symptoms.
    -   Moderate to larger shunts produce the symptoms of congestive heart failure as the pulmonary
        vascular resistance decreases over the first 6 to 8 weeks of life.
2.  The physical examination depends on the size of the shunt, and to a lesser extent the age and
    maturity of the patient.
    -   Premature infants may present with:

        -   Tachypnoea, crackles, tachycardia
        -   Hyperdynamic precordium and bounding pulses with wide pulse pressure
        -   ***Pansystolic*** murmur loudest at the left upper or mid-sternal border.
        -   With a large PDA and equalization of pressure between the main pulmonary artery and the
            aorta, no murmur may be heard.
        -   Soft tender hepatomegaly

    -   Infants and older children with small PDAs may present with:

        -   A pansystolic murmur loudest in the 2^nd^ left intercostal space
        -   Murmur becomes continuous as the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases over the first
            months of life.

    -   Infants and older children with moderate to large PDA may present with:

        -   Louder murmur with a harsh quality and acquires a ***machine-like*** quality often being
            heard posteriorly. A systolic thrill may be felt at the left upper sternal border.
        -   Tachycardia, bounding pulses with a wide pulse pressure, and a mid-diastolic
            low-frequency rumbling murmur may be audible at the apex with a large PDA
        -   With severe left ventricular failure the classic PDA signs may disappear, but there will
            be findings consistent with congestive heart failure (tachycardia, S3 gallop at the
            apex, tachypnoea, soft tender hepatomegaly, bi-basal crackles)
        -   Pulmonary hypertension may occur in long-standing cases. In advanced cases of
            irreversible pulmonary vascular disease, cyanosis occurs with the reversal of shunting.

## Investigations

1.  **Chest X-ray:** Varies from normal (small PDAs) to prominence of main and peripheral pulmonary
    arteries and vasculature. Findings are more pronounced with moderate to large PDAs and may show
    cardiomegaly, and increased pulmonary vascular markings proportional to the left-to-right shunt.
    A dilated pulmonary artery may be seen on the chest x-ray in long-standing cases.
    @fig-cvs-cxr-pda Pulmonary oedema can be seen with congestive heart failure.
2.  **Electrocardiogram:** Findings vary from normal (small PDAs) to evidence of left atrial
    dilatation and left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate to large PDA. Evidence of
    bi-ventricular hypertrophy in long-standing cases. If pulmonary hypertension is present,
    evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy may be seen.

3.  **Echocardiogram:** This delineates the PDA and assesses the size of the left atrium and
    ventricle. Useful for evaluating pulmonary hypertension. Doppler for determining the flow
    pattern.
4.  **Cardiac catheterisation:** most often not essential for diagnosis. Can be performed for
    treatment using transcatheter closure techniques

## Treatment

1.  Supportive treatment including careful use of oxygen and respiratory assistance
2.  Management of CHF with diuretics commonly furosemide and spironolactone, digoxin and afterload
    reduction on a case-by-case basis
3.  Pharmacologic closure of PDA: Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as indomethacin
    or ibuprofen; are not usually effective in infants or older children but are in the early
    neonatal period. Contraindications to pharmacologic closure include co-existing congenital heart
    defects that are duct-dependent, renal impairment, thrombocytopenia and associated conditions
    such as NEC and IVH.
4.  Surgical closure is indicated in symptomatic or haemodynamically significant PDA. Surgical
    closure is achieved by open surgical ligation and division, video-assisted thoracoscopic
    ligation or transcatheter occlusion with coils or other devices.

## Complications

The recognised complication of PDA includes [infectious endocarditis](cvs-inf-endo.qmd), pulmonary hypertension and
heart failure.

## Prognosis

1.  The chance of spontaneous closure in a preterm baby is about 95%, while the likelihood of
    spontaneous closure in a term baby is more than 90% by age 1.[@yuan2021] This is because PDA in
    term infants results from a structural abnormality of the ductal smooth muscles rather than a
    decrease in responsiveness of the ductal smooth muscles to oxygen.
2.  Heart failure and risk of recurrent chest infections develop for large shunts
3.  Large shunts are also a risk for the development of pulmonary hypertension
4.  Surgical treatment now has an almost 100% success rate in many centres.

## Differential diagnosis

Other acyanotic congenital heart diseases are possible differentials. These include a large [atrial
septal defect](cvs-asd.qmd) and a [coarctation of the aorta](cvs-coa.qmd).
